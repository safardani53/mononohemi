Sitting up with your back flush to the chair back and both feet on the ground? That's a sitting position for straight people. It's so "true" that bisexual people don't know how to sit properly that it became a meme.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And then an artist and designer took that meme and designed a chair specifically for bi people. And then a dude with a bisexual kid thought that design was so perfect and funny that he actually built it. And that's how the "Bi-Chair" became a reality.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The notion that bi people never sit normally in chairs may sound like a strangely specific stereotype, but it was actually spread by bi people themselves. Apparently, it's a thing. Sitting with one leg up on the chair, slouched down so you're almost falling off, or spread eagle and hunched over your legs is now a distinctive trait of bi culture.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It was with this hilarity in mind that Brazilian artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Má Matiazi</a> doodled off a design for the "Bi-Chair," which is "designed for people who can't sit straight." Má posted her simple, funny design to her Instagram page on July 26.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The design truly seems perfect for people who can't bring themselves to sit upright with their feet on the floor. And I'm not the only one who thought so. Israel Walker is a Starbucks barista and former member of the Air Force who learned about "bisexual sitting" from his bi, nonbinary daughter. They all thought it was super funny and rooted in truth.</p><p>So, he did what any true ally and father would do: He reached out to Má to ask if he could attempt to actually build the "Bi-Chair," recreating her design. She said yes, and so he did it! He actually brought the Bi-Chair to life, and not going to lie, it is glorious.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Israel posted his handiwork to Facebook in a post that went completely viral. People are loving it. "THIS IS SO PURE," one commenter wrote. "Yo, you need to patent this ASAP," another business-minded commenter wrote. "It's perfect." I mean, just look at it! This person isn't wrong.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Dot</a>, Israel admitted that his design is slightly different from Má's. It's a little bit rougher and has shorter, unfinished arms. He added a cutout for the knee rest as opposed to a two-tiered sloping piece of material. Still, it's clearly Má's innovation come to life, and, as Walker's daughter demonstrates in the pictures he posted, the chair totally works as intended.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>I mean, come on! He totally nailed it! She looks so natural sitting like that in this chair made just for her. What a dad. What an architect. If the bi community has anything to say about this, it's only a matter of time before these chairs are available in stores everywhere.</p><p>So many people in the comments want to see these Bi-Chairs mass-produced. I know I do. God knows bi people have put up with enough crap over the years, what with these dumb, four-legged, one-tiered chairs. It's just not fair.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7Zur8eaoKs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbi-chair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbi-chair.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbi-chair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbi-chair.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbi-chair.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbi-chair.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-does-jimmie-allen-always-wear-a-hat.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-does-jimmie-allen-always-wear-a-hat.html>Why Does Jimmie Allen Always Wear a Hat?
