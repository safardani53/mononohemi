The Portuguese actress, 26, and the Knives Out star, 42, reportedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> during the second weekend of September. The couple had a secret wedding at a private Cape Cod estate.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>From the beginning, Alba and Chris have been notoriously private about their romance. This marks the first marriage for the couple.&nbsp;Fans, of course, know plenty about Chris, but who is Alba? Scroll down for all the key information about Chris’ new bride!</p><h2>Alba is a Netflix star.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Alba got her start in acting at age 16 in <strong>Simão Cayatte</strong>‘s short film <i>Miami</i>. The role earned her the&nbsp;Best Actress Award at the Festival Ibérico de Ciné. Alba starred in more Portuguese films like&nbsp;<i>Caminhos Magnétykos, Equinócio</i>, and <i>Patrick</i>, as well as the TV shows&nbsp;<i>Jardins Proibidos, A Impostora, A Criação, </i>and&nbsp;<i>Jogo Duplo</i>. Her big break came in Netflix’s hit series&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Warrior Nun</a>, based on the comic book character Warrior Nun Areala.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Alba plays Ava Silva, a quadriplegic orphan who discovers she now has supernatural powers that force her to join an ancient order of warrior nuns. Warrior Nun served as her first English-language debut. Warrior Nun&nbsp;premiered its first season in July 2020, and season 2 was filmed during the summer and fall of 2021 in Spain, which is where Alba may have met Chris. The show was canceled after 2 seasons, but the show has been resurrected a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>trilogy of films</a> is on the way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/​Alba-Baptista-chris-evans-embed-1.jpg><h2>Alba started dating Chris in 2022.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>While the dating rumors started in early 2022, Chris and Alba didn’t confirm their romance until Jan. 2023. He posted an adorable video compilation on his Instagram Story of the couple trying to jump-scare each other.&nbsp;“A look back at 2022,” Chris wrote at the top of the video alongside three red heart emojis. While this was Chris’ first-ever confirmation of the relationship, it was reported less than two months earlier that they had been seeing each other for more than a year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Days after Chris was named PEOPLE‘s&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 “Sexiest Man Alive,” </a>a source for the outlet claimed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their relationship was “serious.” </a>The source added, “They are in love and Chris has never been happier. His family and friends all adore her.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Eagle-eyed fans had previously speculated they might be an item in Jan. 2022, as both their social media posts around the time appeared to be in Alba’s native Lisbon.&nbsp;Plus, Chris and Alba’s social media activity made it appear that they were at least talking during the summer of 2021, as that is when Alba followed Chris back on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Chris is not the first actor that Alba has been romantically linked to. She was previously rumored to be dating&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emily in Paris</a>&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lucas Bravo</strong></a>. Apparently, the pair were spotted on vacation together in May 2021, which sparked dating rumors. However, fans pointed out that they very well may just be friends, especially since they were co-stars in the 2022 comedy/drama Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris.</p><h2>Alba is from Portugal.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Alba was born on July 10, 1997, in Lisbon, Portugal. Her mother is Portuguese, while her father is Brazilian and from Rio de Janeiro. The couple reportedly met while Alba’s mother was working as a translator in Brazil.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Alba is from Portugal, so she can obviously speak Portuguese, but that’s not all. The talented star also speaks Spanish, French, English, and German, according to a July 2020 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Universo Online</a>. That means Alba can speak 5 (!) different languages. That’s certainly helpful as she travels around the world for her acting career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/​Alba-Baptista-chris-evans-embed-2.jpg><h2>Alba has dabbled in modeling.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Alba has modeled for one of the biggest names in fashion: Vogue. She made her Vogue Portugal debut in 2019 via a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> meant to look like it was shot on film. She has also appeared on the cover of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ </a>and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ACTIVA</a>.</p><h2>Alba tries to focus on the positive.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Alba has amassed <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>over 700,000 followers</a> on Instagram, and she got candid about how she handles her fame in a 2020 chat with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a>. “I think it’s just to just be grounded about what it means to have attention. You know, everything is such a moment and this is a moment and it will pass, which is fine,” she explained. “So I am enjoying what I can and taking the positive things in and leaving the negative things out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kura7AZpmaqKSewLWtjG1tbGxobIFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-alba-baptista-4634874.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-alba-baptista-4634874.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-alba-baptista-4634874.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-alba-baptista-4634874.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-alba-baptista-4634874.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-alba-baptista-4634874.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./horse-racing-betting-sites.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./horse-racing-betting-sites.html>Best Horse Racing Betting Sites UK - January 2024 Horse Race Bets</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./thom-evans-package-tight-shorts-nicole-scherzinger.html>Thom Evans shows off his muscly legs in tight shorts on casual day out with Nicole Scherzinger T</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./thom-evans-package-tight-shorts-nicole-scherzinger.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
