Come spend time with your daughter instead of fucking me and then this dude right after.</strong></p><p><strong>U need help.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-1024x901.jpg><p>Just two weeks ago, sources claimed that <a href=#>Rob and Chyna were back to having sex</a>… a report that Rob backed up in his many (MANY!) subsequent Instagram photos and captions following his unveiling of this scandalous video.</p><p>Rob wrote on Wednesday morning:</p><p>"That’s crazy u let me cum inside u and then another man do the same in the same bed and the same robe and everything in the house where I pay 16K rent. Sheesh."</p><p>"And so u know she had her butt reduced but I know it still looks wild."</p><p>Kardashian initially included photos of Chyna’s rear end and boobs, along with a picture he claimed to be of her exposed vagina, telling readers that she sent him the latter as a way to entice him into bed.</p><p>He later deleted these racy images, but he continued to hammer Chyna&nbsp;for her cheating, lying and many instances of plastic surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The man who is basically eating Chyna’s face in the above video is named Ferrari. (NOTE: Probably not his real name.)</p><p>He claims on his Instagram page to be a “Musician/Icon/Brand Ambassador/Entrepreneur" and Rob claims that Ferrari has been texting him with requests for money because Chyna now wants Ferrari to act as her sugar daddy.</p><p>He says he can’t afford to foot any of Chyna’s bills, while Rob goes on to say he’s been paying for his ex-girlfriend for several months now.</p><p>And supposedly Ferrari wants to team up with Rob to cash in on… how they’ve both slept with Chyna? We guess?</p><p>"This is the dude Chyna got caught cheating on me with for a minute now," Rob wrote alongside texts he swears were sent to him by Chyna’s new play thing.</p><p>"Look he texted me asking for help and said he needed money cuz he can’t afford to pay Chyna’s bill so that’s why I pay her bills."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"More receipts are coming. Just yesterday Chyna sent me her pussy and everything and said she gonna come fuck me … wait for it."</p><p>"Never once have I cheated on Chyna."</p><p>"I remained loyal to her even after all the cheating she been doing and the multiple men she been fucking including me."</p><p>Rob says he’s probably spent about a million dollars on Chyna since they met. He says he’s paid $90,000 for her necklaces and another $70,000 for a watch.</p><p>Not to mention the $100,000 he doled out to help Chyna lose weight after she gave birth to Dream last November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Late last month, <a href=#>Rob and Chyna took their daughter to Disneyland</a>.</p><p>All has seemed relatively calm between the stars for awhile now actually.</p><p>We’d typically speculate over the legitimacy of heated words such as the ones Rob has fired off today.</p><p>We’d wonder whether this was all scripted and presume it was all a way for Kardashian and Chyna&nbsp;to garner attention and perhaps even tease a new reality series of some kind.</p><p>But that is most definitely a video of Chyna macking it big time with some other dude.</p><p>And this excerpt from Kardashian’s rant is definitely a reference to Chyna&nbsp;being a drug addict, which is a rather serious accusation to merely toss around because you want E! to give you another show:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Wrote Rob toward the end of his postings today:</p><p>"The saddest part is I knew about all this and didn’t say a word or speak on anything because I actually Love Chyna genuinely."</p><p>That is, "until she just sent me a video of her and this man kissing in her bed with my daughter and her son in the house."</p><p>"The same day she sent me pic of her pussy and saying i can come fuck her soon. The same exact day I had 250K of jeweler dropped off to the house."</p><p>"I never been so disrespected by a Woman and I support everything she does until this stuff. Just sloppy and messy and the disrespect."</p><p>"Thank God for my daughter but I will never allow my daughter over to that house that I pay for with all the drugs and alcohol that goes on."</p><p>"I got receipts for days and I’m gonna keep going and I don’t give a fuck."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"The girl told me today she gonna have a third baby daddy and she also told me today she wants to have more kids next year in June."</p><p>"And she sending me videos of her and other man with our babies in the house."</p><p>"And then this thirsty ass dude posting selfies in the house I pay for and bed I made my baby in damn shame."</p><p>Whoa there: Did Rob just threaten to take Dream away from her mother?</p><p>Like we said: this $hit is getting serious.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Rob Kardashian: Roasted on Twitter for Blac Chyna Slut-Shaming</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>We’re way beyond Blac Chyna&nbsp;simply taking her kids to Legoland without Rob here.</p><p>Look for Blac to fire back against Rob at any moment now – and look out for Dream to be just wandering down the street alone one of these days, while her parents continue to blow up at each other over social media.</p><p>That poor child.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:&nbsp;Chyna responded to Kardashian’s allegations on Snapchat, turning the tables on her now-estranged ex in epic fashion:</p><p><a href=#>Chyna says Rob beat her and forced her</a> to stay quiet.</p><p>“On my kids but I’m supposed to be quiet because you’re a Kardashian,” she wrote in a post that has since been deleted.</p><p>“The light will come to the light.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Obviously, this is a developing story. On Sunday, Chyna Instagrammed that she was "single," and "happy" … so there’s that.</p><p>Meanwhile, single father Rob and Dream attended sister Khloe Kardashian’s&nbsp;big Fourth of July celebration on Tuesday.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;</strong>Rob’s Instagram account has been deleted amidst allegations that he’s <a href=#>posting nude photos of Chyna as revenge porn</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped his social media meltdown.</p><p>Rob has taken to Twitter, where he’s continuing to hurl accusations and invective against Chyna.</p><p>He’s also re-posting the offending images that were removed from Instagram.</p><p>We’ll continue to update with further details as more information becomes available.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper
