Not!”</p><p>Hostin was proven wrong when she saw Emmanuel walking through the doors to the church about five minutes after she had arrived.</p><p>"He was gorgeous, decked out in a beautifully tailored suit. … All I could think about was how I could meet this man," she wrote.</p><p>"… I looked ridiculous. I would have to sit and wait. My eyes were glued to his every move.”</p><p>She wrote that she had followed him to a bagel shop where she chatted to him in line and said he was horror-struck when she revealed she had been at church.</p><p>He was horrified that she had attended church in her running clothes, and said years later she realized that it was "blasphemous" in his mind.</p><p>While he didn't seem interested in her at first, she wrote that his friend talked animatedly to her and when he offered his number suggesting she come to one of the parties he and Emmanuel would throw, she accepted it.</p><p>Shortly after, she ran into Emmanuel's friend at a party and he told her of a party he and Emmanuel would be hosting and invited her to come.</p><p>When she showed up at their party, she said she looked very different from when she had first met Emmanuel.</p><p>"He didn’t recognize me," she wrote, "but I said it was nice to see him again. When he asked if we had met before, I told him 'yes,' we’d met in church. That’s still our running joke.”</p><p>Years later, Hostin says: "[Emmanuel] would tell folks that we’d met in a bagel shop, but I’d let him and everyone else know that we’d met in church.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"That’s where the connection happened.
