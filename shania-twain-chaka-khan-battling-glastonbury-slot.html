It would be an incredible honour for either of them — and the hits would please everyone.”</p><p>American Chaka, who is preparing to celebrate 50 years in music, will play a series of shows in the UK next <a href=#>summer </a>but has nothing planned for the <a href=#>Glasto </a>weekend at the end of June.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON GLASTONBURY ">READ MORE ON GLASTONBURY</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘It would be extraordinary’</h2><p>Meanwhile, Canadian Shania will start her latest Las Vegas residency in May but has free space in her diary from the end of that month until mid-August, so plenty of time to prepare for a gig at Somerset’s Worthy Farm.</p><p>Asked in August if she would be doing the Legend slot, That Don’t Impress Me Much singer Shania told Bizarre: “I’m not aware of it yet but wouldn’t that be awesome? I’m not sure where we’re at with that yet.</p><p>“Obviously it would be a dream come true. It’s an incredible honour and I’ve always heard so much about it.</p><p>“It’s the thing. It would be extraordinary. I would do it in a heartbeat, so let’s see what happens.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>Following criticism of an all-male line-up of headliners at this year’s event, organiser Emily Eavis said in October: “Certainly, I can say the legend is female.”</p><p>But perhaps <a href=#>Cher </a>has thrown a curveball after she claimed this week that she also fancies the Sunday after-noon Legend slot — having previously been deemed too expensive. Asked on Radio 2 if she would do it, she said: “I’d like to.”</p><p>Bizarre told this week how <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a> is in talks to headline — after <a href=#>Madonna </a>disagreed with bosses over her fee — while <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a> and veteran Glasto headliners <a href=#>Coldplay </a>are also set to top the bill. With those names in the frame, it sounds like a killer line-up.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Sam’s fight for Xmas No1</h2><p><a href=#>SAM RYDER</a> said he felt like he was in a “David and Goliath” fight with WHAM! on the final day of the battle for <a href=#>Christmas No1</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sam-ryder-this-morning-tv-867491218.jpg><p>The Eighties group’s track Last Christmas was 5,000 copies ahead last night and looked set to clinch the top spot, although Sam hasn’t given up with his Amazon song You’re Christmas To Me.</p><p>Using some fighting talk, Sam, right, said: “I love Wham! – so much respect. But it doesn’t mean that as a new artist with a new song, we can’t absolutely go for it and give it everything.</p><p>“They did exactly the same when they first released <a href=#>Last Christmas</a>. I’m the underdog in this. We were never meant to be in this position. The song was ­written for fun and pure love.</p><p>“There was no expectation it would take on the life that it did. For the past six days we have done 26 performances. That is berserk. We’ve been rushed off our feet.”</p><p>The Xmas No1 will be revealed just after 5.30pm on <a href=#>Radio 1</a> this evening.</p><p>&nbsp;One thing is for sure – it’s nice to have quality festive tunes fighting it out after years of <a href=#>LadBaby</a> and his sausage rolls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/9e893cfa-571a-4e35-8ce3-66716c80908e.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/beyonce-instagram-867599483.jpg><p>SHE’S had one of the biggest years of her career so it’s no wonder <a href=#>Beyonce </a>decided to go undercover in this gear for a day out in New York.</p><p>The Cuff It singer wore shades and a faceless balaclava as part of her all-black outfit, as she was joined by husband <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> and their children.</p><p>They rented an entire bus which offers 90- minute tours of the Big Apple, complete with afternoon tea and scones.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Kanye to lose £3m on LA pad</h2><p><a href=#>KANYE WEST</a> has once again proved he has more money than sense, selling his multi-million pound home at a loss after just two years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kanye-west-seen-leaving-vogue-866514266.jpg><p>The rapper splashed out £45.3million for the huge Californian home in late 2021 then proceeded to gut the entire place, despite it only being ten years old.</p><p>But it seems he has now changed his mind and is selling it in a right mess.</p><p>It has gone back on the market for £42million, with the estate agent admitting that whoever takes it on would have to pump millions more into it to bring it up to scratch.</p><p>Kanye has seen his net worth plummet in the intervening years, after brands stopped working with him due to his controversial views. Perhaps he should go for a more humble abode next time.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">With Abba, Stratford Takes It All</h2><p><a href=#>ABBA</a> Voyage is bringing in the Money, Money, Money for East London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/attend-red-carpet-ahead-abba-736092179.jpg><p>New figures show the jaw-dropping show in Stratford has banked a massive £322million for the surrounding area since opening at the purpose-built, 3,000-seat Abba Arena in May 2022.</p><p>The show, now booking until November 2024, sees digital versions of the iconic Swedish group perform seven times a week.
