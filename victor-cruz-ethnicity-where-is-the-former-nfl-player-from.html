<time>28 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Victor Cruz has mixed ethnicity and grew up in a Spanish household.</strong> <strong>The 2011 Super Bowl champion Cruz’s mother has Puerto Rican roots, and his father came from an African-American background.</strong></p><p>After his dad passed away in 2007, the former New York Giants wide receiver was brought up by a single mother. Cruz is native to Paterson, New Jersey, with his father being a retired firefighter.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/victor-cruz-super-bowl.jpg><p>After going undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft, a scout named Chris Pettit recommended Victor to the Giants. He told the Giants they wouldn’t regret giving Cruz a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In his six seasons with the Giants, Cruz played 70 games, totaling 4,549 receiving yards and 25 touchdowns. Cruz won the Super Bowl XLVI with <a href=# rel=noopener>Eli Manning</a> leading the offense and the New Jersey native being his top target.&nbsp;</p><h2>Victor Cruz Ethnicity: Where Is The Former NFL Player From?</h2><p>The former NFL player Victory Cruz comes from a family with mixed ethnicity. His father, Mike Walker, was a man of African-American background, and his mother, Blanca Cruz, comes from Puerto Rican heritage.</p><p>Victor’s father, Mike Walker, was a retired Paterson, New Jersey firefighter and committed suicide in 2007. In a 2015 documentary, I Am Giant: Victor Cruz,&nbsp;the former NFL player talked about his father’s demise.&nbsp;</p><p>In the documentary, Cruz broke down while talking about his father. He said his father’s demise kept a chip on his shoulder and made him focus on his craft.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/victor-cruz-ethnicity.jpg><p>Raised by his single mother, Blanca, Victor grew up in a Spanish household. In an interview, Victor said when he was a kid, his fashion sense was influenced by his mom’s side family.</p><p>But as a teenager, the influence of his African-American background started catching up. His mother, Blanca, worked at the Benjamin Moore customer service department and worked hard to put food on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>During a conversation with AQ, Cruz said his mother would always find a way to surprise him, and if he wanted to wear something special, she would always figure out a way to get it for him on the holidays.</p><h2>Victor Cruz Partner: Who Is The NFL Player Dating?</h2><p>Earlier this year, Victor Cruz and a mystery woman enjoyed a downtime in Barbados. In his interview with The New York Post, the former NFL star didn’t confirm his relationship status.</p><p>He only referred to the mystery woman as a “lovely lady.” On his Instagram, the one-time Super Bowl Champion hasn’t shared any picture that would give hints about his relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Victor was previously engaged to Elaina Watley, with whom he shares his daughter, Kennedy. The two began dating in 2008 and welcomed their daughter in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>The wide receiver proposed to his longtime girlfriend in 2014 during a baby dedication ceremony for his daughter. The proposal video was later shared on the internet, with Cruz saying he was nervous before he dropped the bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/victor-cruz-daughter.jpg><p>But their engagement only lasted a year, with Elaina finding out Victor cheated on her with multiple women. In his interview with E!, Cruz said his toxic relationship with Elaina made it harder for them to co-parent their daughter positively.&nbsp;</p><p>After breaking up with Elaina, Cruz dated actress Karrueche Tran. Victor and Karrueche began dating in 2017 but went their separate ways in February 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>In an episode of The Pivot Podcast, Cruz said it was nothing malicious, and they felt they needed to do things separately.&nbsp;</p><p>On his Instagram, Cruz has shared several photos and videos with his daughter, Kennedy. The father-daughter duo can be seen doing photoshoots for various brands. The two also enjoy playing golf, with Victor sharing a sweet photo of them on Father’s Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDCyJyrqKpdmL%2B2xoyeq6GmmZi2tcWMsJ%2BeqpVitrR506GcZp6fp7qmvoynnaVloKGuurHRZp2rp51k</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvictor-cruz-ethnicity-where-is-the-former-nfl-player-from.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvictor-cruz-ethnicity-where-is-the-former-nfl-player-from.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvictor-cruz-ethnicity-where-is-the-former-nfl-player-from.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvictor-cruz-ethnicity-where-is-the-former-nfl-player-from.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvictor-cruz-ethnicity-where-is-the-former-nfl-player-from.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvictor-cruz-ethnicity-where-is-the-former-nfl-player-from.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jay-cinco-girlfriend-and-age.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jay-cinco-girlfriend-and-age.html>Did Jay Cinco Break Up With Girlfriend?
