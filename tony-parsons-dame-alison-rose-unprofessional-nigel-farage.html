Sorry — “a leak” doesn’t quite cover it.</p><p>Now this lucky Dame will pocket more moolah over the next year than most of the “little people” who bank with NatWest will make in their working lifetime.</p><p>And what has always fascinated me personally about this ugly story is what Dame Alison Rose actually looked like when she was telling big fat fibs about Nigel Farage to the business editor of the <a href=#>BBC</a>.</p><p>Because I am guessing that there was a degree of snickering going on.</p><h2>Fabulously rich</h2><p>I am assuming that there was a malicious smirk hovering around Rose’s cakehole when she told Simon Jack that Farage had failed to meet the financial bar at Coutts.</p><p>I reckon that Rose — a banker, lest we forget, and not a guardian of moral virtue — despises Farage and everything he stands for.</p><p>And it is impossible to understand how someone can act in such a grotesquely unprofessional fashion as <a href=#>Dame Alison Rose</a> and then grow fabulously rich on the proceeds.</p><p>But I guess these fat cats always take care of their own.</p><p>And while Nigel Farage had his bank account closed by Coutts over fears of reputational damage, we now learn that serial killer Rose West, murderer of ten women and girls, was deemed fit to remain a customer of the Co- operative Bank.</p><p>I guess <a href=#>Rose West</a> must have voted Remain.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Jen unlucky in love? Not a Pitt of it</h2><p><a href=#>JENNIFER ANISTON</a> reckons that her attitude to relationships – maybe we are all better off alone – has a lot to do with her parents divorcing when she was nine.</p><p>“I didn’t like the idea of sacrificing who you were or what you needed, so I didn’t really know how to do that,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/e61d2aee-aa90-44cc-91d7-a1821240c05f.jpg><p>“So it was almost easier to just be kind of solo. So I didn’t have any real training in that give and take.”</p><p>Some say that twice-married, twice-divorced Jen, right, is unlucky in love.</p><p>Oh, I don’t know.</p><p>I will have to ask my female friends.</p><p>But surely no woman who was married to <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> for five years can be de-scribed as&nbsp;being&nbsp;unlucky in love.</p><p><a href=#>FREDDIE MERCURY</a> would have understood why <a href=#>Fat Bottomed Girls</a> is being left off a new Queen compilation.</p><p><span id=5b120640-e50f-412a-84bc-80f57e14d566 class=suggested-link>Fred</span> would have quipped something cutting – he once told a colleague of mine at the NME, “Darling, I thought you would be editor of The Times by now!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/freddie-mercury-queen-performs-stage-779729150.jpg><p>But Fred&nbsp;would not have objected to protecting the sensitive modern world from controversial Fat Bottomed Girls.</p><p>These old rockers always censor themselves.</p><p>If they live to be 100 – and they will – you will never again hear the <a href=#>Rolling Stones</a> singing Brown Sugar.&nbsp;</p><p>Old rockers are canny coves.&nbsp;That’s why they last so long.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>SPORT RACE FAITH</h2><p>SPORT is colour blind.</p><p>When <a href=#>Tyson Fury</a> fights <a href=#>Deontay Wilder</a>, no <a href=#>boxing</a> fan thinks of the bout as a white bloke fighting a black bloke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tyson-fury-punches-deontay-wilder-699994131.jpg><p>When Fury squares up to Wilder, we see a heavyweight who can dance like Fred Astaire confronting a man who punches harder than anyone in the sport’s <a href=#>history</a>.</p><p>Nobody gives a damn about the colour of their skin.</p><p>So how depressing to hear Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones complaining about the lack of diversity in England’s World Cup Lionesses on <a href=#>Sky</a> <a href=#>News</a> during a <span id=dfeb0186-a012-4185-9d49-3a908e960ecc class=suggested-link>review</span> of the papers.</p><p>“What jumps out at you is that this doesn’t represent diverse Britain,” suggested Wilfred.</p><p>“It’s all these blonde blue-eyed girls – and I wish them well – but I do think we need to ask ourselves questions about why there is a lack of diversity.” No, we really don’t.</p><p>There were players from ethnic minorities in the Lionesses’ squad.</p><p>They were there on merit. Sport doesn’t give a damn what <span id=16f76b5a-a854-4a06-9e4c-2570287c4683 class=suggested-link>race</span> you are.</p><p>If only the rest of the world was the same way.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>WILLIAM WINS FA</h2><p>WHATEVER <a href=#>Prince William</a> did last weekend, he was going to get slaughtered.</p><p>If Wills had made a flying visit Down Under to watch <a href=#>England</a> play <a href=#>Spain</a> in the Women’s World Cup Final, he would have been criticised by the green lobby.</p><p>I can see the HEIR MILES! headlines now.</p><p>And if he was in and out of Oz in 24 hours, chippy Aussies who want to ditch <a href=#>the Crown</a> would have frothed at the mouth because he didn’t find time to kiss a few koalas.</p><p>So William’s decision to stay home and watch it on the telly was probably the least bad option, even though he was then slagged off for staying away – because he is President of <a href=#>the FA</a>!</p><p>I hope <span id=60105789-8d43-4bcb-abce-c25b221c9b46 class=suggested-link>William</span> stays as the face of the FA because he is a genuine fan of our national sport.</p><p>And sometimes a <span id=4dac907b-3425-4361-ba83-f79293d8b838 class=suggested-link>future</span> king just can’t win.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>CROFT AN ACE CHOICE</h2><p>IT is the time of year when grumpy old newspaper columnists love to moan about the contestants in the next series of <a href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</p><p>But not this year.
