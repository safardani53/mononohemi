The hit Apple TV+ series starring <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a> will return for season 3 in the fall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-morning-show-season-3-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The official season 3 trailer was released on August 24 and teased the epic drama on and off the air. Alex is determined to have a say “in the future” of UBA. “What you are asking is unprecedented,” Cory tells her in the trailer. Alex responds, “I am unprecedented.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>UBA becomes the target of a cyber attack, and The Morning Show goes dark right in the middle of a broadcast. Bradley soon warns that secrets will come out. “I know I made a huge mistake, but I am handling it,” Bradley says in the trailer. Cory urges Bradley to “fix it” or he’ll do it himself.&nbsp; Meanwhile, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jon Hamm’s</strong></a> Paul Marks comes into the picture as a “lifeline” to save the company. Alex gets wrapped up in Paul’s world, and there’s definitely romance at play.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The first trailer dropped on July 27 and hinted at more tension between Alex and Bradley. Alex declared she wanted all the secrets of the network to come out. “They didn’t protect me,” she said. Bradley snapped back, “They didn’t protect you, but I did.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>There will be a number of changes in front of and behind the camera with The Morning Show season 3. Acting heavyweights have joined the show in key roles. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up all we know so far about The Morning Show season 3.</p><h2>The Morning Show Season 3 Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Apple TV+ released an official premiere date for The Morning Show season 3. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Filming wrapped</a> on February 9, 2023, and season 3 will premiere this fall on September 13 with the first two episodes. One new episode will then premiere every Wednesday through November 8 on Apple TV+. On April 30, Apple TV+ announced that The Morning Show had been renewed for season 4… before season 3 even premiered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-morning-show-season-3-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The first season premiered on November 1, 2019. Apple TV+ released the first 3 episodes before moving to a weekly drop. With season 2, only one episode dropped per week.</p><h2>The Morning Show Season 3 Cast</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong> and <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong> will return for The Morning Show season 3 as Alex Levy and Bradley Jackson. They’ll be joined by other returning cast members, including <strong>Billy Crudup’s</strong> Cory Ellison, <strong>Mark Duplass’</strong> Chip Black, <strong>Julianna Margulies’</strong> Laura Peterson, <strong>Karen Pittman’s</strong> Mia Jordan, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Greta Lee’s</strong></a> Stella Bak, and more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>When she finished filming her final season 3 scenes as Alex, Jennifer shared sweet behind-the-scenes photos from the set on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. She also included a heartfelt video of herself tearing up while saying goodbye to the cast and crew.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Reese also reflected on filming season 3 during her last days on set. From set photos to selfies with Jen, a fun time was clearly had by all. “Last days of shooting @themorningshow. Season 3 is on the WAY!” she captioned her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>There will be several new additions to The Morning Show season 3. Mad Men alum <strong>Jon Hamm</strong> will play Paul Marks, a corporate titan who sets his sights on UBA, pulling Cory, Alex, and Bradley into his powerful orbit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>Nicole Beharie</strong> has joined the show as Christina Hunter, a grounded, competitive, and charismatic millennial who is a new anchor on The <span class=markt629np9dj data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Morning</span>&nbsp;<span class=mark5nyt53ehg data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Show</span>. Christina works hard, plays hard, and navigates the Teacup with good-humored irreverence. Nicole recently starred in Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul and Scenes From A Marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-morning-show-season-3-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Parks & Recreation alum<strong> Natalie Morales</strong> will recur as Kate Danton, Stella’s best friend from Stanford&nbsp;where they were part of a start-up incubator run by Paul Marks, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. <strong>Tig Notaro</strong> will play Amanda Robinson, the chief of staff to corporate titan Paul Marks, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a> reports.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19><strong>Stephen Fry</strong> has joined the cast as Leonard Cromwell,&nbsp;a ruthless UBA board member working to steer the company through troubled financial waters, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. Stephen recently appeared in The Sandman and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Red, White & Royal Blue</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>While it was touch-and-go whether or not <strong>Marcia Gay Harden&nbsp;</strong>would be able to return as journalist Maggie Brener, Jennifer confirmed in her season 3 wrap post that Marcia will be back in season 3.&nbsp;“If we could work it in so that Maggie could come back for a day or two, I would love that,” Marcia had previously told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a>. “She’s got to drum up another interesting story. And I think because of how it was left off, she has to drum it up with a different kind of humanity.”</p><h2>What Will Happen In The Morning Show Season 3?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>The official synopsis for season 3 reads: “In season three of The Morning Show, the stakes are high as the future of the network is thrown into question and loyalties are pushed to the brink when a tech titan takes an interest in UBA. Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponized, and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>The stars have been pretty tight-lipped about The Morning Show season 3 spoilers. However, Jennifer was able to tease the new season during her March 2023 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Everybody has a secret. We’re revealing a lot of secrets. There’s definitely romance,” Jennifer said. She mentioned her new co-star, <strong>Jon Hamm</strong>, in her interview. “We were very excited to get Mr. Hamm,” the Murder Mystery star gushed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>There will be a bit of a time jump in season 3. “Well, we start after the pandemic,” Karen told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a> in August 2022. “I think I can safely tease that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Morning-Show-Season-3-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-25>Reese also teased to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a> that “there is lots of romance this year.” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jennifer and Jon were spotted</a> a number of times filming scenes for the show, indicating that Alex and Paul could be striking up a romance in season 3. It’s time for Alex to be happy!</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>Reese revealed that Paul is a “very complex character” in an interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. She added, “He’s a media mogul and he gives Billy Crudup a run for his money, which I think is the most fun part too, because Billy could eat a scene like I’ve never seen somebody eat a scene, and Hamm gets to come in and give him a great foil.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-morning-show-season-3-embed5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-27><strong>Kerry Ehrin</strong>, who stepped down as showrunner ahead of season 3, revealed at the end of season 2 that she definitely wanted to see “more of Bradley and Laura” in season 3. “I feel like Alex has come to a place for the first time since the pilot of accepting who she is and facing her worst fears, and I want to see how the phoenix rises from the ashes for her, and learning how to have a full life and be present and loving,” she told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. “I know these don’t sound like big, hooky plot points, but this is how I begin a story: I begin from what I see inside the character and what I want to experience next with them, and I feel like Alex deserves that at this point. I’m curious where the fate of UBA is going. I love the Cory-Stella relationship. I think they are a great story about sort of the transition of the old world and the new world, and I think they’re both just such rich characters, and I’m excited to see how they develop.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>Kerry will continue to be a consultant in season 3. <strong>Charlotte Stroud</strong> took over as showrunner of The Morning Show.</p><h2>What Happened In Season 2?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-29>The Morning Show season 2 was a whirlwind from start to finish. Mitch Kessler, the controversial morning show host played by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Steve Carell</strong></a>, drove his car off a cliff and killed himself. And that was just episode 7 of the second season.</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>Season 2 ended in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic with a number of loose ends. Daniel quit his job to be with an elderly loved one during the pandemic. In the season 2 finale, Alex got COVID-19 and ended up detailing her experience with it on the new streaming service UBA+. After a hard year for her, this could signal her big comeback in the public eye.</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>Cory finally admitted that he is in love with Bradley, who became romantically involved with Laura in season 2. Bradley wasn’t able to respond to Cory’s declaration of love because she got a call that her brother had been found in a hospital. Cory and Bradley raced to the hospital and walked into a COVID-infested emergency room without any PPE protection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Morning-Show-Season-3-apple-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-32><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong> revealed she’s invested in this love triangle. “I’m really interested in their love triangle between Laura and Cory, the complexity of the chemistry she has with Cory,” the actress told The Hollywood Reporter. “But, again, it’s a person she works with, so I’m really curious how it all plays out.” <strong>Billy Crudup</strong> admitted that he doesn’t “know what kind of potential there is in the future [with Cory and Bradley].”</p><p id=content-paragraph-33>As for Bradley’s relationship with her brother, Reese is “really interested in what the next step would be” after the season 2 finale because “it’s such a big piece of her life. Your siblings can really define you, and either help you or torpedo you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OhnGaln6e7qrrGZqqhp6diwKat0qilZmtdan10gJJwa2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-morning-show-season-3-5034374.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-morning-show-season-3-5034374.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-morning-show-season-3-5034374.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-morning-show-season-3-5034374.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-morning-show-season-3-5034374.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-morning-show-season-3-5034374.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charlize-theron-plastic-surgery.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charlize-theron-plastic-surgery.html>The Truth Behind Charlize Therons Plastic Surgery Rumors</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ryan-seacrests-dating-history-julianne-hough-more.html>Ryan Seacrests Dating History: Julianne Hough, More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ryan-seacrests-dating-history-julianne-hough-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
