<time>13 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h3>Since May 2016, when the actress filed for divorce, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been embroiled in a years-long legal battle over multiple lawsuits. She’s been through a lot, but she never forgets to thank her fans.</h3><h3>Heard recently took to social media to thank her fans worldwide for their unwavering support, displaying a slew of posters created by them. She shared an Instagram photo of herself posing with a poster that read,</h3><h3>“We Are With You Amber Heard.”</h3><h3>Another poster read,</h3><h3>“You Are Our Real-Life Superhero,” and another, “I Just Want To Read Books And Smash The Patriarchy.”</h3><h3>Along with the photos, she wrote a sweet note to her adoring fans, saying</h3><h3>“I’m with you too.”</h3><h3>Thank you for your unwavering support from around the world.</h3><h3>“I take notice of you.”</h3><h2>Heard Continues To Face Backlash On Social Media.</h2><p>Following her victory in a legal battle with her ex-husband in the United Kingdom, the 34-year-old actress has been subjected to online harassment. Depp’s fans have been targeting Heard since a judge ruled that Depp was abusive during their relationship. They’ve bombarded Heard with messages expressing their desire for her death.</p><p>Some of the trolls also went after Heard’s late mother, Paige Parsons, saying, “If your mother could see what you do, she’d be happy to die.”</p><p>And the situation remained unchanged after Heard won another victory when the court denied Depp’s request to rescind the court’s decision. She continued to face criticism from internet users, but by then she had had enough of it and mocked the haters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Amber-Heard-1-2.jpg><h2>Influence On Career</h2><p>The Pirates of the Caribbean star was fired from his role as Grindelwald in ‘Fantastic Beasts 3’ after losing a court battle against The Sun newspaper. Fans were outraged, and an online petition was started to have the actress ‘Seen’ removed from ‘Aquaman 2’.</p><p>The organizers of the petition claimed that Heard, like Depp, should be treated fairly and asked that she be removed from her big-budget franchise. Heard plays Mera in Aquaman 2. As of this writing, the petition had received over 1.8 million signatures.</p><p>This fueled speculation that Heard had been let go from Aquaman 2. They were quickly shut down, however, following an Entertainment Weekly article. While speaking out against Depp, Heard admitted that she had been dropped by corporations and had lost her job.</p><p>In reality, the actress posted a picture of herself practicing for Aquaman 2 on Instagram just a few days ago. The petition appears to be pointless.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYppqVp3qpscCrm2asmJa7rL%2BMrKypqJ%2Bnwaa%2B0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famber-heard-thanks-supporters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famber-heard-thanks-supporters.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famber-heard-thanks-supporters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famber-heard-thanks-supporters.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famber-heard-thanks-supporters.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famber-heard-thanks-supporters.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./julia-roberts-was-tortured-by-steel-magnolias-director-says-sally-field-2013264.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./julia-roberts-was-tortured-by-steel-magnolias-director-says-sally-field-2013264.html>Julia Roberts Was Tortured by Steel Magnolias Director, Says Sally Field</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./britney-breaks-silence-with-candid-poem-over-feeling-numb-and-escaping.html>Britney breaks silence with candid poem over feeling numb and escaping Wed 4 May 20</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./britney-breaks-silence-with-candid-poem-over-feeling-numb-and-escaping.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
