Fractional odds are more common in the UK – particularly in horse racing – so we’ll go with those for an example.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, odds can be as short as they need to be, but on the Betfair Exchange scale the shortest price a horse can be is one hundred to one on, or 1-100. That means that you would need to place £100 in order to win just £1 and in the eyes of the bookmakers that horse would have a 99% chance of winning the race.&nbsp;</p><p>As the odds get bigger the percentage of the horse winning gets smaller. The middle ground mark of this scale is even money or ‘evens’, where the odds read 1-1. That means that if you stake £5 you will win £5 plus your stake and your horse has a 50% chance in the race in the eyes of the bookmakers.&nbsp;</p><p>That means that anything that is shorter than evens – i.e. is ‘odds on’ - therefore has a greater than 50% chance of winning in the eyes on the market. For example, a 10-11 chance would have a 52.4% chance of success.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s say we have a seven-runner Cheltenham Gold Cup, with the following market; Kauto Star 2-1, Denman 3-1, Imperial Commander 6-1, Cue Card 8-1, The Giant Bolster 12-1, Burton Port 16-1, Time For Rupert 33-1.</p><p>At those odds, Kauto Star is the favourite as he is the shortest price in the market and therefore has the best chance of winning. In percentages, Kauto Star is thought to have a 33.3% chance of winning the Gold Cup, while Time For Rupert is the least likely to win, with a 2.9% chance.&nbsp;</p><p>A perfect betting market should tally up to 100% when you add up the probabilities of every horse in the race, with any extra accounting for the bookmakers’ profit margin. In this case, the odds of all seven horses add up to 101.1%.</p><p>If you think Kauto Star is going to win and you would like to stake £5 on him, you would win £10 and also get your £5 stake back if he was successful, meaning you’d get a return of £15 for your bet. A bet on Denman would return £20 with his odds of 3-1 should he win, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>In more competitive races like the 40-runner Grand National, the prices are likely to be much bigger to reflect that fact that the race is harder to win. However, if you can find the winner, the return will almost certainly be worth your while!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Most Popular Horse Racing UK Bet Types</strong></h2><p>After&nbsp;you're done with account opening, you'll be able to place bets like acca, win only, and others. Bear in mind that sports bets have terms and conditions, so make sure to read up on those before gambling. Here are the types of sports bets you can place:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Win only bet&nbsp;</h3><p>There are lots of different ways to place a bet when it comes to betting on horse racing, with the most simple being a ‘win only’ bet. This means that your whole stake is being placed on a horse to win a particular race and you only get a return if they pass the post in front. For example, £5 on a horse to win at 4-1 would return £25 as described above.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Each-way betting</h3><p>Another hugely popular way of placing a bet on racing is through ‘each-way’ betting. Once again, you are picking one horse in a particular race, but with an each-way selection you are placing two separate bets. For example, if you place £5 each-way on Frankel at 10-1, £5 is placed on the horse to win and the other £5 is staked on the horse to place.&nbsp;</p><p>That means that your £5 on the horse to place will bring a return if your selection finishes second or third – and sometimes fourth, fifth and sixth depending on the type of race and the number of runners – with the place part usually paying a fifth of the win odds.&nbsp;</p><p>Rates can vary of course, but if Frankel finishes third and you’ve backed him each way at 10-1, most firms would pay a fifth of the odds on that. Half of your stake that was placed on Frankel to win would lose, but the other £5 would be a winner at 1/5 of the odds, or 2-1 in this case. You’d therefore get a return of £15 on your £10 each-way bet and a £5 profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Exacta</h3><p>Another race specific bet is an Exacta, which requires you to find the horses who you think will finish first and second in race. Picking them in an exact order is known as a straight Exacta, while with a reverse Exacta the order of the horses doesn’t matter as long as they finish first and second.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also place bets which require more than one horse to win in horse racing, which are known as multiple bets. There are a wide range of multiples available, including the following…</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Double</h3><p>A double involves placing a single bet on two horses to win two different races. For this bet to land, both horses need to win. For example, you could have a £5 double on Denman to win the 13.00 at Kempton Park at 11-8 and Menorah to win the 13.10 at Sedgefield at 13-8. The double would pay at just over 5-1, with your £5 stake returning winnings of £31.17.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Treble</h3><p>This carries the same principle as a double, except you are using three selections rather than two. You can have as many horses in a win multiple as you like and after a treble they are generally referred to by the number of horses in the bet; a four-fold, a five-fold, a six-fold and so on.</p><p>For a treble, you could have a £5 multiple on each of Long Run in the 14.30 at Cheltenham at 2-1, Synchronised in the 14.40 at Uttoxeter at 5-1 and Hedgehunter in the 17.00 at Aintree at 3-1. The treble pays a whopping 71-1, with £5 returning a cool £360.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lucky 15</h3><p>This bet is slightly more complicated than those above it, but it is a hugely popular for horse racing bettors. You pick out four horses for a Lucky 15 bet, which is a combination of 15 different bets on those four horses.</p><p>If you were to stake 50p on each outcome, the total cost of the bet would be £7.50 and for that you would get four singles, six doubles, four trebles and one four-fold selection to boot. You only need one horse to win to guarantee yourself a pay out, though your potential winnings can shoot up quick if multiple horses win.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Heinz</h3><p>This is similar to a Lucky 15 bet, though it involves more selections. You may be able to twig why this bet was named the Heinz, as you need to find six horses you fancy for this type of bet, which adds up to a total of 57 wagers.</p><p>You can get big rewards for small stakes with this type of bet and if you were to stake just 5p on every single outcome, your total bet would be £2.85. For that you would get yourself 15 doubles, 20 trebles, 15 four-fold accumulators, 6 five-fold accumulators and 1 six-fold accumulator.</p><p>Unlike the Lucky 15, you would need to get two winners to get a return this time, though things quickly build up if you can find three or more winners.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Placepot</h3><p>This type of bet is specific to one meeting and is synonymous with the Tote. A placepot requires you to pick one horse to place in each of the six selected races on the card.</p><p>You would only get a return if each of your six horses at that meeting – let’s say Cheltenham – finish in the places that day and the number of places on offer per race will depend on the number of runners in each contest, so make sure you check before placing it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Horse racing betting offers</strong></h2><p>There are some fantastic betting offers available if you shop around, with bookmakers offering plenty of lucrative terms in order to seal your custom. Our top pick for betting on horse racing is the Tote and you can get £30 in free bets when you sign up and stake £10 on a horse. It doesn’t matter if your selection wins or loses, once it settles you will get £30 in Tote credits put into your account to spend on the racing.</p><p>Another fantastic offer is with <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">bet365</a>, where you can get £50 in free bet credits when you sign up and stake £10.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere there’s <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>kwiff</a>, another of our top pics, who offer a free £10 bet when you stake £10 and they also have a rather unique function.

Make sure you look out for reviews of betting apps to get a feel for which providers offer the fastest and simplest experience.</li><li readability=5><strong>Offering</strong>: Although you’re ideally looking for a speedy app, you don’t want to sacrifice your betting experience for it and you still need to look out for apps which offer as many sportsbook markets as you need. For example, if you’re a distances punter, it would not be helpful to choose an app which tends to only offer more simplified betting – like win only, each-way and exacta bets.<p>It's also a good idea to check out what else the operator has on their website. In addition to sports bonus offers, some sites also have casino bonus offers. Bear in mind that each casino offer will likely have a wagering requirement and be limited to one household, one IP address, and one phone number.&nbsp;</p></li><li><strong>Streaming</strong>: If you’re betting on the go, you’re going to want to be able to watch the racing on the go, too. You want a betting app that is going to be able to reliably show you coverage of all the racing in Britain and Ireland – with anything overseas a big bonus.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Reviews</strong>: As mentioned above, your peers are a powerful ally, and reviews on the app store are a very helpful tool when it comes to choosing a betting app. A quick browse on the review section of your app store can help you get a feel for which betting apps are going to be the best suited to you and your needs.</li><li><strong>Fast withdrawals:</strong> having access to a sportsbook that processes withdrawal requests quickly is convenient, especially if you are looking to cash out the balance from your account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>With all of this in mind, one sportsbook which offers an excellent app is <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">William Hill</a>. Its mobile app is great for betting on horse racing. The interface is very similar to the website and you can watch lots of racing for free, with 24 racecourses on William Hill Betting TV.</p><p>Streaming is also readily available to horse racing punters who have placed a bet too if your racecourse isn’t in that list of 24, while there are lots of other perks to being a Hills punter. The most notable is their Bet Boost promotion, which gives you the chance to enhance one selection each day – on stakes up to £20 – making it perfect for your daily nap selection.</p><p>Another excellent betting app is provided by BetVictor, which has a similar feel to their website and is easy to navigate. BetVictor’s streaming offering is solid and you also have the assistance of free Timeform verdicts on every British and Irish racing to help you make your selection. On top of this, they run an excellent ‘Run For Your Money’ promotion. This offer just gives you a little bit of peace of mind, as they will refund your stake if your horse refuses to race or loses all chance in the stalls.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">William Hill</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/william-hill-logo.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Best UK payment methods for online horse racing betting</strong></h2><p>The most popular payment method for betting on horse racing is with your debit card, which almost all bookmakers will accept.</p><p>Generally, you will find that payment methods with UK bookmakers are straightforward and they won’t accept things like Bitcoin or cryptocurrency as deposit methods. General payment methods that are accepted are as follows:</p><p>It’s worth noting that you can no longer use your credit card to bet with UK bookmakers. You can only make debit card deposits with Visa and Mastercard, while some betting sites have payment restrictions on bonus bets if you are thinking of using e-wallets for these promotions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to sign up to a horse racing betting site</strong></h2><p>Signing up to a horse racing betting site is a straightforward process once you know who you would like to bet with. Make sure you have a good shop around and look at things like sign up offers for new members and what the bookmaker offers and whether it suits what kind of experience you are looking for – this guide should hopefully offer you some good advice.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Once you have made your decision and picked a sign up offer, you need to head to the sign up page of that bookmaker. Some sign up offers will come with links that you can click – like above – that remove the need to go looking for the sign up page, while some other sign up offers will come with offer codes that you will need to remember and input when asked.&nbsp;</li><li>When you reach the sign up page, you will be required to input your details and confirm that you are 18 or over through age verification – some bookmakers may also require you to send things like identification documents and utility bills depending on their process.&nbsp;</li><li>Once you have put in your details, you will need to agree to the terms and conditions of the site and click ‘sign up’. You may be sent an email confirmation with a link to click – but otherwise you should be ready to place some bets on the horse racing!</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to place a bet on horse racing</strong></h2><p>Once you have your account set up and you’re ready to place a bet on a horse, you need to log into the site. It may be at this point that you choose which horse you’d like to back, in which case there is often plenty of form and free tips available for you to browse on the betting site which can help you come to a decision as to who you’re going to back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: Let’s say you’ve decided to place a bet on Kauto Star in the 12.00 at Leicester on your William Hill app. Once you have signed up and logged in to your account, you need to navigate to the horse racing markets section of either the website or your betting app. Once there, you need to find the British racing, and click on Leicester.</p><p>Navigate your way to the 12.00 contest, where you should see the names of the runners and a list of horse racing odds next to each name. Find Kauto Star and press on his odds, which in this case are 2-1. This will bring up a betslip either on your page on the desktop, or it may open a separate window on your app depending on what interface you’re using. You then simply need to input your stake – in our case it would be £5 win – and press ‘place bet’. You should then get your confirmation and also be shown whether streaming for that horse race is available.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best horse racing festivals in the UK</h2><p>Horse Racing is a year-round sport and there is almost always a big race taking place in the UK – with ITV Racing there to cover it each Saturday. Some meetings are bigger than others, however, and we’ve listed some of the UK’s best horse racing festivals of the year below.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cheltenham Festival: Tuesday 14th March – Friday 17th March 2023</h3><p>Known as the ‘greatest show on turf’, the Cheltenham Festival is one of the few horse racing events each year which gains mainstream coverage. Running for four days in March, the schedule is packed with some of the best Jumps racing the sport has to offer, with no less than 14 Grade One Races.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, there are five ‘Championship’ races at Cheltenham; the Champion Hurdle (Tuesday), the Queen Mother Champion Chase (Wednesday), the Ryanair Chase (Thursday), the Stayers’ Hurdle (Thursday) and the sport’s blue riband race, the Cheltenham Gold Cup (Friday).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Grand National Festival: Thursday 13th April – Saturday 15th April 2023</h3><p>Aintree comes into the spotlight in April with the Grand National Festival, which is headlined by the world’s most famous steeplechase competition. There is some top-class racing on the first two days of the meeting before the eyes of the world turn to Merseyside for the <a href=#>Grand National 40-runner spectacular</a> over those world-famous fences.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Guineas weekend at Newmarket: Friday 5th May – Sunday 7th May 2023</h3><p>The Flat takes center stage for the first time in May, with the first two Classic races of the season at Newmarket, the 1000 and 2000 Guineas. This is the first opportunity for the three-year-old fillies and colts to showcase their ability on the big stage and the Rowley Mile is usually packed on 2000 Guineas Day – with around 20,000 people in attendance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Epsom Oaks and Epsom Derby: Friday 2nd June and Saturday 3rd June 2023</h3><p>The second Classic races of the season for the fillies and the colts are held at Epsom, in the form of the Epsom Oaks and the world-famous <a href=#>Epsom Derby</a>. With its challenging undulations and tough bends, the Derby and the Oaks provide a stiff test for these top-class three-year-olds, in front of a massive crowd. Entry is free on The Hill enclosure and thousands of people usually gather for the big race.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Royal Ascot: Tuesday 20th June – Saturday 24th June 2023</h3><p>June is a huge month for Flat racing, with the eyes of the world being on Ascot for its Royal meeting later in the month. The five-day festival was one of the late Queen’s favourite events of the year and some of the very best horses from around the world head to London to take part in some world-class horse racing.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>🏇 🎁 Get the <a href=#>best odds for Royal Ascot</a>! 🎁 🏇</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Glorious Goodwood: Tuesday 1st August – Saturday 5th August 2023</h3><p>One of the most glamorous race meetings of the year is the five-day festival at Goodwood, which is known as ‘Glorious Goodwood’. Expect the champagne to be in full flow across the five days, with one of the key races being the Group One Sussex Stakes, one of the first opportunities for the three-year-old generation to test their mettle against the older horses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>St Leger Meeting: Thursday 14th September – Sunday 17th September 2023</h3><p>The final Classic race of the season is held at Doncaster. Run over a mile and three quarters, the St Leger is the longest of the three Classic races and horses need to have a mix of class and stamina if they are to come out on top. The race is the oldest of the Classic races, dating back to 1776.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">BetUK sign up</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Sun-Betuk-Reviewed-By-Us-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Bet £10 get £30 in Free Bets</p><p>New customers, Deposit & Place a Bet within 7 days, and settle a £10 minimum bet at odds of 4/5 (1.8) or greater, to be credited with 3x £10 free bets: 1 x £10 Horse racing, 1 x £10 Free Bet Builder and 1 x £10 Football.

There are so many things to consider when placing a bet on a horse and we’ve provided a few tips to help you get as much information as possible before picking a horse to bet on.</p><ul><li><strong>Watch lots of racing</strong> – this may seem obvious, but the easiest way to build up your understanding of horse racing is by watching as much of it as possible. This should help you pick up things like jargon and your understanding of things like odds and you should also get a good feel for the form – figures can help, but seeing a horse perform in a race is the best way to get a feel for their chances next time!</li><li><strong>Understand the form</strong> – Everyone uses different methods to choose the horse they want to bet on and it may be that picking out your favourite number or colour of silk works for you. However, in the long term it can be a big help if you use a horse’s form to get a good understanding of how they have been performing in the short term and what they have shown throughout their career. Sites like Racing Post and Timeform can help you when it comes to that.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Learn the jargon</strong> – Horse Racing can feel like it has its own language at times, but getting familiar with all the jargon can help you with your understanding of the sport. Learning about things like conditions races and cheekpieces will stop you having to do so much homework. Learn what <a href=# aria-label="betting terms (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">betting terms</a> like trifecta and superfecta mean, and learn about horse racing-specific terminology.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Study the riders</strong> – Racing has plenty of stars in the weighing room and it can pay to follow certain jockeys. Frankie Dettori and Oisin Murphy are two of the best riders around on the Flat, while Rachael Blackmore has been a sensation over the Jumps in recent years. A lot of these horsemen have an excellent track record, so if you want to place a winning ticket, follow their work.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Note down impressive horses</strong> – Your eyes are your biggest ally when it comes to horse racing betting and if something catches your eye, it’s worth noting them down. It’s easy to forget certain performances just due to the amount of racing that’s on each year, so using notebooks – or online trackers – are an excellent way to keep on top of things.</li><li><strong>Use information</strong> – If you want to increase your funds, you have to learn everything you can about horse racing, horses, and jockeys. It's the only way to stay on top so you wouldn't end up losing a bet. We have so much information at our fingertips in this day and age and luckily a lot of it is free to boot. You’ll be surprised just how much form and tips are available for free on betting sites, while places like Timeform and the Racing Post are excellent resources.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which are the best bookies for horse racing betting?</h2><p>A good bookie will give you the option to bet on multiple sports so you could tailor each bet to a specific game. The same goes for horse racing - there's plenty of variety.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to betting on UK horse racing, we are spoilt for choice, with a multitude of options on the market. Quantity doesn’t always translate into quality however, and some providers are certainly better than others when it comes to offering betting on horse racing. We’ve listed our top 10 bookmakers for racing above and our top pick is the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Tote</a>, who have a bespoke racing offering.</p><p>If you are a racing person, Tote is an excellent starting point as they have an almost dedicated offering of markets on racing around the world.
