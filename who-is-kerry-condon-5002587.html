The two play siblings in the dark comedy, which also stars <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brendan Gleeson</strong></a> and has received critical acclaim across the board.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Kerry stands alongside iconic <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actresses vying for the 2023 Golden Globe honor</a>, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Angela Bassett</strong></a>&nbsp;for her role in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Carey Mulligan </strong></a>for journalism drama She Said,&nbsp;<strong>Dolly De Leon</strong>&nbsp;for Triangle of Sadness,&nbsp;and<strong> Jamie Lee Curtis</strong> for Everything Everywhere All At Once.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Here are five things to know about Kerry as she prepares for the Golden Globe Awards on January 10.</p><h2>She’s been acting since her teens</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kerry-condon-golden-globes-ev-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>According to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wikipedia</a> page, Kerry first appeared onscreen at the age of 16 in the 1999 film Angela’s Ashes. Just a couple of years later, at the age of 18, she played Mairead in&nbsp;<i>The Lieutenant of Inishmore&nbsp;</i>at the Royal Shakespeare Company. She was also notably the youngest actress to take on the legendary role of Ophelia in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Hamlet in 2001, also at 18. Clearly, she was off to an illustrious start, even at a young age.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Nobody ever really put the connections together of me having done the plays and things [before film and TV], and I do like that being known, because I did get started very young,” she told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Indiewire</a> in November of 2022, just as Banshees was taking off as an early awards contender.</p><h2>Kerry is an accomplished stage actress</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>As mentioned above, Kerry, began serious work as a stage actress at a very young age, taking on notoriously difficult roles and nailing them with grace. In fact, the film’s director, <strong>Martin McDonagh,&nbsp;</strong>says he wanted to capture her brilliance onstage, and translate it to the screen. “I don’t think I’d quite seen how brilliant she was onstage really captured in the movies,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair.</a> “I wanted to make sure that we did that, and she just blew me away.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Martin cast Kerry in his play The Lieutenant of Inishmore&nbsp;when she was all of 17. Clearly, they’ve been a powerful team ever since.</p><h2>She’s been acting in TV & films for years</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Martin accomplished his goal of getting Kerry’s talents to shine on both the big and small screens. She’s made a name for herself in the HBO/BBC series Rome, in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Walking Dead</a>, and in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Better Call Saul</a>. She also sports high profile roles in films including Avengers: Quantum Encounter (voice work), Unleashed, Intermission, and Ned Kelly, among others. Her role in Martin’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oscar winning</a> Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was a small one, but it clearly reinforced her bond with the director.</p><h2>She has a close working relationship with Colin Farrell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Kerry-Condon-The-Banshees-of-Inisherin-ev-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Kerry’s natural dynamic with Colin Farrell in The Banshees of Inisherin is no accident.<span> Her past working relationship helped make her comfortable with a man who has become <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an enormous star.</a> “I knew Colin from a very long time ago, my second job ever was this TV show called Ballykissangel, and it was very early on in his career that we were both on this show,” Kerry told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ScreenRant</a> in an October 2022 interview.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><span>“</span><span>Then, we knew each other, and we did this other movie called Intermission in Ireland, another Irish movie about, like, 16 years ago. </span><span>Basically, it wasn’t my first time meeting him, and that helps, that was the first thing that kind of helped. I didn’t have to get to know him.”&nbsp;</span></p><h2>She’s grateful for a seasoned career</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>In her September 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>, Kerry admitted to feeling grateful for the decades long journey acting had taken her on thus far. “After the 24 years I’ve been an actress, it’s like, yeah, I feel grateful,” she told the magazine of the critical acclaim over Banshees. “Different jobs give you different gifts—that’s what’s great about being a working actor. If you got <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>famous very young</a>, you’d miss all these nuggets. You can learn so many things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K4pr7RsmScp56ZvK95lGlna21obHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-kerry-condon-5002587.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-kerry-condon-5002587.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-kerry-condon-5002587.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-kerry-condon-5002587.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-kerry-condon-5002587.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kerry-condon-5002587.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-rachel-dillon-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-rachel-dillon-dating.html>Who is Rachel Dillon Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-troy-bridges.html>What Happened to Troy Bridges?
