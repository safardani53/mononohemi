<time>14 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>One of the greatest and most famous athletes during the ’90s, Karl Malone, has a net worth of $55 million in 2023. His net worth is a result of his 19 years of service in the NBA.</strong></p><p>At the peak of his career, Malone earned a staggering $19.2 million yearly salary with the Utah Jazz in the 2002-03 season. Above all, Karl was the second-best player during his era, the only player better than him being the GOAT Michael Jordan.</p><p>The 14-time All-Star is just as successful in his business ventures, if not more than in his playing career. For instance, the Hall of Famer has more than 14 business ventures in various cities, including his hometown of Louisiana.</p><p>The NBA legend partnered with the Brookshire Grocery Company to donate $50,000 worth of products to the victims affected by the tornado on December 17, 2022, in union Parish.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hjnkml..png><p>But how did the kid who grew up with eight other siblings accrue a net worth of $55 million? Who guided the 14-time All-Star in his successful business ventures?</p><p>Well, at the end of this article, you will be enlightened on the questions asked above. You will also find information regarding early life, NBA salary, contracts, and wife.</p><p>Before all that, let’s go through his quick facts.&nbsp;</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table width=717><tbody readability=4.7598522167488><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Karl Anthony Malone</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>July 24, 1963</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Summerfield, Louisiana</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Karl Malone</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>African-American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Summerfield High School&nbsp;<br>Louisiana Tech University</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Leo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Shedrick Hay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Shirley Malone</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>60 Years Old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>6’9″/2.06 m/206 cm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>117 kg/259 lb</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>Yes (December 24, 1990)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wife</strong></td><td>Kay Kinsey</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Kids</strong></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td>Forward</td></tr><tr><td><b>Active Years</b></td><td>1985-2004</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Clubs&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Utah Jazz, Los Angeles Lakers</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Awards</strong></td><td>Southland Player of the Year&nbsp;<br>2×&nbsp;NBA Most Valuable Player<br>14×&nbsp;NBA All-Star&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td><strong>$55 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.71428571428571><td><strong>Merch</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Autographed Jersey</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Biography Book</a>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>November 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Brief Bio</h2><p>Karl “The Mailman” Malone was born on July 24, 1963, in Summerfield, Louisiana, to his supporting father, Shedrick Hay, and mother, Shirley Malone.&nbsp;</p><p>His father, Shedrick, committed suicide, which brought all the responsibility of raising nine children to his mother.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, from an early age, Malone had to step up and help his mother by chopping trees, hunting, and fishing to feed the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/malone-247.jpg><p>The former LA Lakers power forward attended Summerfield High School, where he led the team to three consecutive Louisana Class C titles.</p><p>A lot of universities were interested in Malone, but it was Louisiana Tech University that won in the end. The primary reason was that the university was closer to his home.</p><p>But, the future Hall of Famer had to wait a year to make his debut for the team as his grades were too low. Subsequently, the 6’9″/2.06 m&nbsp;forward impacted his second season with the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs.</p><p>Karl averaged 18.7 points and 9.3 rebounds per game, which impressed Louisiana Tech and advanced him to the NCAA tournament for the first time in its history.</p><h3>NBA Career & Achievements</h3><p>Malone’s NBA career started when Utah Jazz picked him as the 13th overall pick at the 1985 NBA Draft.&nbsp;</p><p>The Louisiana native stayed with the Jazz for an incredible 18 years, unheard of in today’s NBA due to a lack of loyalty in players and franchises.</p><p>He led his team to two NBA finals in 1997 and 1998. Unfortunately, the Jazz lost both those finals to Chicago Bulls led by the great <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>.</p><p>Although Malone could never win a team award, he made it up with his impressive haul of personal achievements, which are listed below:</p><ul><li>2 times NBA Most Valuable Player (1997, 1999)</li><li>14-times NBA All-Star (1988-1998, 2000-2002)</li><li>11 times All-NBA First team (1989-1999)</li><li>Two-time All-NBA Second team (1988, 2000)</li><li>Three times NBA All-Defensive First Team (1997-1999)</li><li>1986 NBA All-Rookie First Team</li><li>No.32 retired by Utah Jazz</li><li>NBA’s 50th Anniversary All-Time Team</li><li>1983 Southland Player of the Year</li><li>No.32 retired by Louisiana Tech</li></ul><h3>LA Lakers</h3><p>Even though Malone stayed with Utah based franchise for 18 years, he played his final season for the Los Angeles Lakers to achieve his dream of becoming an NBA Champion.</p><p>At the time, the Lakers were fresh off their 3-consecutive championships and boasted world-class players such as <a href=#>Kobe Bryant</a>, <a href=#>Shaquille O’Neal</a>, and <a href=#>Gary Payton</a>.</p><p>Therefore, expectations were high when the two-time MVP signed with the franchise, as everyone thought the Lakers would be crowned champions for the fourth consecutive year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/malone-003.jpg><p>Contrary to the 1997 and 1998 campaigns with the Jazz, Karl fell short at the last hurdle. To explain, the Los Angeles-based franchise did reach the NBA finals in the 2003-2004 season.</p><p>To the surprise of almost everyone, an inspired Detroit Pistons team led by <a href=#>Chauncey Billups</a> comfortably beat the Lakers in five games.</p><h2>Net Worth, NBA Contracts & Salary</h2><p>The Mailman is worth <strong>$55 million </strong>in 2023 due to his nearly two decades of career in the NBA. Also, Karl had various sponsorship deals that contributed to Malone’s massive net worth.</p><p>Over 19 years of service in the NBA, the Mailman has earned over $105 million in salaries alone. His net worth shouldn’t come as a surprise because the former Jazz power forward was probably the second-best player of his generation.</p><p>To illustrate, Malone won the NBA MVP award twice between 1997 and 1999. Malone was also one of the highest-paid players of his era.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/malone-249.jpg><p>You may be wondering exactly how much the 14-time All-Star earned during each of his nearly two-decade stay in the NBA. Well, don’t worry, as we’ve got you covered.&nbsp;</p><p>The following is a list of career earnings and contracts of Malone throughout his nearly 20-year stay in the NBA:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Seasons</strong></td><td><strong>Earnings&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1985-86</strong></td><td>$225k</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1987-88</strong></td><td>$835k</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1988-89</strong></td><td>$1.3 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1990-91</strong></td><td>$2.26 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1991-92</strong></td><td>$2.55 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1992-93</strong></td><td>$2.85 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1993-94</strong></td><td>$3.08 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1994-95</strong></td><td>$3.37 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1955-96</strong></td><td>$3.67 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1996-97</strong></td><td>$4.65 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1997-98</strong></td><td>$5.11 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1998-99</strong></td><td>$6.14 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1999-00</strong></td><td>$14 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2000-01</strong></td><td>$15.75 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2001-02</strong></td><td>$17.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2002-03</strong></td><td>$19.25 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2003-04</strong></td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Career Stats</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Season</strong></td><td><strong>Team</strong></td><td><strong>GP</strong></td><td><strong>Min</strong></td><td><strong>FG%</strong></td><td><strong>REB</strong></td><td><strong>AST</strong></td><td><strong>STL</strong></td><td><strong>BLK</strong></td><td><strong>PTS</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>2003-2004</strong></td><td>LA</td><td>42</td><td>32.7</td><td>48.3</td><td>8.7</td><td>3.9</td><td>1.2</td><td>0.5</td><td>13.2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Career Stat</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1476</td><td>32.7</td><td>51.6</td><td>10.1</td><td>3.6</td><td>1.4</td><td>0.8</td><td>25.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Houses & Cars</h2><p>Big expensive houses and cars have become a norm for the wealthy. Karl is no exception, as he is one of the most significant real estate moguls in Louisiana.</p><p>To illustrate, Malone currently resides at his Ruston, Louisiana house, which is worth $8 million.</p><p>The two-time MVP once lived in one of the most luxurious houses in Utah. The 19,000-square-foot home included two swimming pools, a shooting range, 11 baths, and a beautiful backyard.</p><p>Nonetheless, Malone had to sell the house as he went to Los Angeles to play for the LA Lakers in the 2003-04 season. As a result, the home was listed at $6 million for the auction conducted by Craig King.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/malone-bike.jpg><p>Later, it was sold for a mere $2.5 million, less than half the original price. The man who bought the mansion was none other than Dwight Manley.</p><p>In addition to owning several houses, the 14-time All-Star is a proud owner of a vast fleet of vehicles.</p><p>For instance, Malone owns a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which costs around $30k. Also, the 2.06 m forward owns several Toyota cars. He also holds a Dodge Charger GT with a price of $35k.&nbsp;</p><h2>Business Endeavor</h2><p>Karl is one of the most successful entrepreneurs who boasts a host of businesses under the umbrella of Malone Properties.</p><p>One might be forced to think that the 14-time All-Star would take a break and enjoy his wealth and fame. Instead, he worked on expanding his business venture, which is listed below:</p><ul><li>Arby’s/Texaco in Ruston</li><li>Teriyaki Grill franchise in Ruston</li><li>230-acre cattle ranch</li><li>Three Jiffy Lube franchises in Utah</li><li>Part owner of two Burger King franchises (Utah and Idaho)</li><li>22-acre Karl Malone Used Car Outlet Toyota in Sandy</li><li>Karl Malone Toyota in Draper</li><li>Two condos at Green Valley Resort in St. George</li><li>M&M Automotive in Sandy</li><li>Body Shop/Collison Center</li><li>Eskimo’s Ice Cream</li><li>Karl Malone Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in Heber City</li></ul><p>In addition to the long list of business ventures, Malone owns a few thousand acres of Louisiana timberland property. The two-time MVP has a 37-acre outdoor mall in his hometown of Ruston.</p><h3>Deer Raising Venture&nbsp;</h3><p>The Louisiana native has a deer-raising venture on 300 acres of fenced property. Malone has been raising white-tailed and axis deers inside the property for years.</p><p>If that isn’t enough, Karl owns Malone Outfitters, through which he takes his clients on hunting trips on his 300-acre deer property.</p><p>One might wonder where the 2.06 m power forward learned his business trade. Well, no need to worry, as the man behind Malone’s success is none other than his former boss, Larry Miller.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/malone-deer.jpg><p>The late entrepreneur, car dealer, and Jazz owner helped the 14-time All-Star in his on-court activities and off-court activities.</p><p>According to Malone, “Larry and I talked about everything. One of the things he told me is to have a passion for whatever you do, not do business just to do it. You do it to make a profit. You’ve got to ask questions.”</p><p>Furthermore, the Louisiana native has also tried his hands in the entertainment industry.</p><p>He appeared in two movies, Rockwell (1994) and Soul Plane (2004). He has a recurring cameo called “All Alone with Karl Malone” in the hit talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live.</p><h2>Charity Work</h2><p>Having grown up living a poor life out of necessity, Malone does everything within his capabilities to help needy families and kids.</p><p>As a result, Karl runs the Karl Malone Foundation, which financially supports kids and their families. He donated supplies worth $200k to Navajo Indians.</p><p>Similarly, the two-time MVP also donated $6k to the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush, along with $2k to the 2004 US Senate campaign of Lisa Murkowski.</p><p>Also, Karl is a member of the Board of Directors of the National Rifle Association (NRA), whose primary aim is to teach firearm safety and competency.</p><h2>Wife & Family</h2><p>The Mailman is married to 1988 Miss Idaho, Kay Kinsey. Precisely, the couple got married on December 24, 1990, inviting each other close friends and family.&nbsp;</p><h3>Children</h3><p>The two lovebirds have been blessed with four lovely kids daughters Kadee Malone, Kylee Malone, Karlee Malone, and son Karl Junior.</p><p>Malone had three children with another two women. Malone and Bonita Ford gave birth to twins; a son Daryl Ford and a daughter Cheryl Ford.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Karl-Malones-Family.jpg><p>Secondly, the Hall of Famer had another child, <a href=#>Demetress Bell</a>, with Gloria Bell. Astonishingly, Gloria was only 13 years old when she gave birth to Demetress.</p><p>Nonetheless, those incidents happened in the past and should be left there. As of 2023, Malone is a family-oriented guy who loves spending time with his children and his wife, Kay.</p><h2>Dunk Contest 2023</h2><p>NBA Hall of Famer Karl Malone will return to the arena he played in for 18 seasons on Saturday, February 18, 2023.</p><p>The former Jazz forward will judge the Slam Dunk Contest as NBA All-Star Weekend returns to Salt Lake City for the first time since he shared All-Star Game co-MVP honors with John Stockton in 1993.</p><p>The contest will feature New Orleans’ Trey Murphy, Houston’s KJ Martin, New York’s Jericho Sims, and Philadelphia’s Mac McClung.</p><h2>Popular Quotes</h2><ul><li class=Qynugf>“Sometimes, you follow your dreams.
