<time>06 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Chase Mattson, Kelianne Stankus's fiance, is in hot waters after one of his recent shirtless posts hit the internet.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He was accused&nbsp;of&nbsp;body-shaming, after an opinionated post surfaced on Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>However, after some backlash, he has now&nbsp;removed the caption from his post on Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Here's a look into the whole saga.</p><h2 id=Chase+Mattson+Got+Backlash+for+Body+Shaming name=Chase+Mattson+Got+Backlash+for+Body+Shaming>Chase Mattson Got Backlash for Body Shaming</h2><p>This&nbsp;controversy seems to have started with one of his recent shirtless posts on Twitter.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Mattson, a self-professed gym rat, is usually posting shirtless pictures of himself on his socials, whether that be from inside the gym or outside. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On January 9, 2022, Mattson posted a shirtless&nbsp;gym selfie showing off his abs on Twitter. In the caption, he wrote, "Dad Bod" followed by a biceps emoji.</p><p>His followers, however, seemed to take offense in the fact that he called his chiseled body a "dad bod." Many of the comments were from those who were upset at him for doing so.</p><p>"Not a dad bod, not old enough to be a dad. Call me when you cross the 40 threshold!" said one. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When someone else countered saying Mattson already had two kids, he said the traditional definition of a "dad bod" did not fit his body.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Someone else asked, "In what reality is this dad bod?" Replying to this response, another added&nbsp;saying, "A land of disillusionment."</p><p>There were many others who denied his body was a fit for the dad bod category of body types. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This wasn't the first time Mattson has posted pictures with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">same caption</a>. However, this was the only time he got considerable backlash. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It might have been these responses that prompted Mattson to clarify his position on the argument.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On January 19, he uploaded a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">few pictures</a> on his Instagram and Facebook with a long caption. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Some people don't realize that I've been modeling longer than I've been a dad," Mattson began the caption.</p><p>He then claimed that men, more so than women,&nbsp;being the biggest targets of body shaming and bans, was not the indicator for social equality and self-love.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the next line, he made it clear that he was not attacking&nbsp;any gender. But he wished that everyone was held to the same standard when posting online.</p><p>Regardless of whether it is a man or a woman posting about something they are proud of, in this case, their bodies, Mattson demanded equality in scrutiny and judgment. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ending his writing, he requested everyone ask&nbsp;him about his story before hating him or making uninformed judgments.</p><p>"E.L.E. everybody love everybody," he wrote at the end.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2 id=Chase+Mattson+Deleted+His+Caption+on+IG name=Chase+Mattson+Deleted+His+Caption+on+IG>Chase Mattson Deleted His Caption on IG</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Mattson's post gathered a lot of traction on Instagram. He received many comments, both agreeing and disagreeing with his sentiments.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The first one of those supporters was his fiancee, Stankus. "I love you," she expressed. "Proud of you," accompanied by a red heart emoji.</p><p>Another model, Michael Yerger, too showed his support. He said that Instagram didn't let him post pictures of his Dolce & Gabbana campaign.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>There were people who also disagreed with his claims. Women came at him saying he was wrong to claim that men's bodies were more sexualized than women's bodies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Following some backlash in the comment section, Mattson removed his entire caption.</p><p>He replaced his words with two emojis, implying he was keeping quiet now.</p><p>However, the deleted caption is still up&nbsp;in his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook post</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After this, he uploaded another post where he answered some of the questions fans asked about him.</p><p>Here, he revealed that he was a 27-year-old model with two daughters, and had been modeling since he was 18.</p><p></p><p><strong>Chase Mattson with his two daughters.</strong> (Photo: Chase Mattson/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Talking about movies, he said he wanted to be a lead in a Marvel or DC movie â€” didn't matter if he was a hero or a villain. His favorite movies were&nbsp;Interstellar, Saving Private Ryan, and <a href=# rel=follow>Gladiator</a>.</p><p>He then revealed things about his private life, admitting that he had never been engaged or married before meeting&nbsp;Stankus.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Mattson and Stankus <a href=# rel="follow noopener">got engaged</a> on December 12, 2020, in the most romantic way possible in Malibu.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>As of September 2021, the couple was <a href=# rel=follow>getting ready</a> for a wedding and a baby.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In their plans, the wedding is&nbsp;happening in 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuYlsCmecyaq62rn6N6tLTIq6ulnaOoeqO7w7JloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchase-mattson-shirtless-body-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchase-mattson-shirtless-body-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchase-mattson-shirtless-body-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchase-mattson-shirtless-body-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchase-mattson-shirtless-body-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchase-mattson-shirtless-body-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./emma-watson-topless-for-natural-beauty.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./emma-watson-topless-for-natural-beauty.html>Emma Watson: Topless for Natural Beauty!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./andi-peters-wiki-is-he-married-net-worth-relationships-and-personal-life.html>Andi Peters Wiki: Is He Married?
