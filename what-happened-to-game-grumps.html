The thread included screenshots of text messages and a video she said Dan Avidan sent to her. He cannot be seen in the video, but a voice can be heard describing a&nbsp;jacuzzi tub in the speaker's hotel room. The content of the video is sexually explicit.&nbsp;</p><p>The woman alleged that she began exchanging text messages with Dan Avidan in 2013 when she was 17. (He would have been 34 at the time.) The two first connected when she shared that she was a fan of his.&nbsp;</p><p>The woman claimed that their conversations became sexual in nature once she turned 18. According to her post, they did have a sexual interaction once they met in person in 2017, which was when she was in her 20s. She said that he stopped talking to her after they were intimate.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though people were accusing Dan Avidan of grooming, neither the messages nor the woman's story indicates that anything sexual occurred until she was of legal age.</p><p>About 11 months before this viral Reddit post, several other women shared stories about how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Avidan ghosted them</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to the earlier Reddit thread, Dan Avidan had a pattern of reaching out to women and leading them on to believe that they'd have a monogamous relationship. After having a sexual encounter, he would then stop speaking to them.</p><p>None of the women who shared their stories in this thread were underage at the time when these encounters occurred.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dan Avidan released a statement about the viral Reddit post.</h2><p>Just a few days after the Reddit post made the rounds online, Dan released a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a>.</p><p>He denied having a sexual relationship with anyone who was underage. He noted that the woman mentioned in the thread was 22 years old at the time when they became physical.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I stand by the fact that any interactions that took place of a sexual nature with the person in question were done so when she was 22 years old and we were both consenting adults. To claim I engaged in any predatory behavior is simply untrue," he stated. "I have made mistakes in the past, and I apologize if my actions or words ever made anyone upset, but those mistakes were never ill-intentioned, exploitative, or illegal in any capacity."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Dan Avidan has been in a relationship with Ashley Anderson for several years. He has not shared when exactly he began dating the animator, so it's unclear if they were together when the other alleged encounters took place.</p><p>The accusations have not been discussed on the Game Grumps YouTube channel, nor have they been mentioned on the show's official Instagram or Twitter pages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSgmZ2aeqi%2B1KanrA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-game-grumps.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-game-grumps.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-game-grumps.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-game-grumps.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-game-grumps.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-game-grumps.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./coronavirus-outbreak-factory-nottinghamshire.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./coronavirus-outbreak-factory-nottinghamshire.html>72 employees catch coronavirus at dessert factory in Nottinghamshire after area added to local lockd</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./snapchats-new-map-feature-which-lets-you-trace-peoples-locations-sparks-stalking-and-bullying-fears.html>Snapchat's new Snap Maps feature lets you trace people's locations sparking stalking and bullying fe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./snapchats-new-map-feature-which-lets-you-trace-peoples-locations-sparks-stalking-and-bullying-fears.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
