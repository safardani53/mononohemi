David was the No.1 tennis player in Argentina in his category when he was twelve.</p><p>David Nalbandian stands at 5 ft 11 inches tall. Further, he is currently 41 years old & has officially retired from professional tennis. Additionally, he started his career at the age of 18.</p><p>Possessing an athletic and healthy body, for most of his career, David weighed 79 kgs.</p><p>Thus, he maintained his diet and remained at this weight as it was efficient to play for him at this body weight.</p><p>You can also check <a href=#>Ugo Humbert Bio: Early</a> <a href=#>Life,</a><a href=#> Tennis, Career & Net Worth</a>.</p><h2>David Nalbandian: Professional Career</h2><h3>Early Career&nbsp;</h3><p>David started his tennis career as a junior and even won the US Open boy’s single by defeating<a href=# rel=noopener> Roger Federer</a>. He reached World No. 3 in rankings in 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2000, he became a full-time professional tennis player. David reached the ATP top 50 for the first time in 2001, just one year after going professional, which is a huge deal for many tennis professionals.</p><p>2002 was a great year for David as he finished as No.1 in Argentina and South American for the first time. In addition, he won two ATP titles and also reached the Wimbledon finals that year.</p><p>He wins against various players, David Sánchez, Paul-Henri Mathieu, George Bastl, Wayne Arthurs, Nicolás Lapentti, and Xavier Malisse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/David-on-Field.jpg><p>Likewise, Nalbandian did not do very well in 2003 due to a stomach injury. David did not win any titles in 2004 either, but he completed as runner-up in Rome Masters and Madrid Masters.&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time in David’s career, he made it into the top five of the ATP Men’s Rankings in August 2004. However, he dropped to number nine in the rankings at the end of the year.</p><h3>Career Statistics</h3><p>David quickly reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, Wimbledon Open, and the US Open in 2005. Moreover, he also won the Tennis Masters Cup.</p><p>Additionally, he is the second-ever Argentine in history to win the Tennis Masters Cup, a year-end tournament after defeating World No.1 <a href=#>Roger Federer.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>This win made him the first player ever to win the cup without winning any Grand Slam or Masters Series title, which was a huge accomplishment.</p><p>The Argentine reached the Australian Open semifinals in 2006 before losing to Marcos Baghdatis. He was the second active player to have reached the Grand Slam Tournament’s semifinals after Federer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Roger-and-David-after-winning-a-match-1.jpg><p>David also reached the semifinals of the French Open and the Wimbledon Open. Unfortunately, he had to opt out of the French Open due to a stomach injury in the middle of the game.&nbsp;</p><h3>Last Half of the Career</h3><p>2007 definitely was not a good year for David Nalbandian because he dropped out of the top 20 for the first time starting from 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, he suffered from multiple injuries such as a back injury, a stomach injury, and a leg injury during the year. However, he bounced back when he phenomenally won the Madrid Masters.</p><p>Similarly, he is the third person ever to win over the world’s top three seeds in a single competition.&nbsp;</p><p>After that win in 2007, Nalbandian secured a spot back in the top 10 and started another season in that ranking. However, he failed to impress the Australian Open and did not reach the quarterfinals.</p><p>He won the Copa Telmex in Bueno Aires, which landed him to the top 8. David also reached the finals of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in Acapulco.&nbsp;</p><p>He wins his tenth career ATP Title at Medibank International in Australia. Nalbandian also participated in the NBP Paribas Open in California, losing to Rafael Nadal.&nbsp;</p><h3>Injuries and Out of Form</h3><p>David had to go through surgery on his hips, which meant that he could not participate in any other events for the year. He also did not participate in any of the Grand Slams.</p><p>Despite initially being ready for the Australian Open in January, he had to withdraw due to an abdominal injury.&nbsp;</p><p>David also had a lot of injuries in 2010. He had to face several knee injuries that barred him from almost all of the tournaments earlier that year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/David-Nalbandian-after-a-win..jpg><p>However, the injury did not stop David from winning the Legg Mason Tennis Classic. He was also awarded the Platinum Konex Award as the best tennis player in Argentina in the last decade.</p><p>In 2011, David started the season as World No. 27. However, he immediately forwarded to rank No. 21 after performing at the Auckland Open and No.1 in Argentina.</p><p>You Might be Interested: <a href=# rel=noopener>Andreas Seppi: Tennis Career, Ranking, Wife & Net Worth</a></p><h3>Fined for Misconduct</h3><p>David Nalbandian was fined $12,560 after a match with Isner in the Australian Open due to unsportsmanlike conduct following the match.</p><p>The incident was broadcast live when he kicked a seated line judge in the shin. This kick heavily injured the linesman and even drew blood.</p><p>Owing to this incident, David Nalbandian had not just to pay the $12,560 fine, but his prize money was also forfeited.</p><p>His total losses incurred up to $69,910. Additionally, his rankings were taken away by ATP as well.</p><p>When he started the Wimbledon Championship, he was an unseeded player. David was defeated in straight sets in the first round of the Championship.</p><p>David Nalbandian had to withdraw from the US Open due to a strained muscle in his chest. So, he withdrew one day ahead of the US Open and canceled his first-round match.</p><p>David appeared in Davis Cup, representing Argentina in 2013. Apart from that, he had to undergo shoulder surgery, which stopped him from playing other tournaments during the year. As a result, David announced his retirement in 2013.</p><h3>Style of Play</h3><p>David Nalbandian was an amazing tennis player with a clean ball-striker and an all-court efficiency. His serve was not as great as another fellow top 20 seeds, but he was good enough.</p><p>David carried off his game in speed, anticipation, and ability to endpoints at the net. He is quite famous for his double-handed backhand down the line.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being considered one of the best and compared to <a href=# rel=noopener>Roger Federer</a> during his early years, David failed to live up to the mark.</p><p>Some commentators have even mentioned that David was one of the biggest underachievers in tennis history.</p><h2>David Nalbandian After Tennis & Retirement</h2><p>Showing his passion deep-rooted for sports, David chose a career in another sport after retiring from tennis.</p><p>He started his career as a race car driver and often went rallying in the Argentine Rally Championship.</p><p>David has marked his feat in rallying and has made appearances in the Codasur South American Rally Championships and World Rally Championship once.</p><p>Nalbandian has multiple rides, but he prefers to race in an Argentine specification of the Chevrolet Agile launched in 2009.</p><h2>Personal Life, Net Worth & Social Media</h2><p>According to his social media platforms, Nalbandian is a fairly private person, where he only shares his work and career-related activities.
