He's the twin brother of Violet Betty, who was born one minute after he entered the world, at 1:24 p.m.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time of Alexander's birth, Bass announced his arrival on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> and shared that he was born 18.5 inches long, weighing 4 lbs., 14 oz. "The baby dragons have arrived!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️&nbsp;," he captioned the post in part.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after their babies' births, Bass and Turchin quickly picked up on their character traits. "Since two months old, we knew their personalities, and they've just gotten more exaggerated," the former boy band member told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December 2021, Bass said Alexander was "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>such a sweet, docile little boy</a>." Meanwhile, he shared an update in February 2023 that was quite the opposite.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bass joked that Alexander "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>just wants all the attention and just wants to get in trouble all the time</a>." The new dad revealed that he's "learned patience," among other lessons as a result.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lancebass/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the challenges of parenting toddlers,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the couple spoke to PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;about how fatherhood had been treating them in December 2021. In fact, Bass noted that it's "been a lot easier" than expected. "We're just lucky — and knocking on wood right now that this doesn't change," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They've been so well-behaved. They don't make too much noise. They cry when they need to get changed and fed," the musician added. In February 2023, Bass told PEOPLE that Alexander said his first word in January. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>So all those little milestones are just so precious</a>," he said at the time.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turchin told PEOPLE that he's most looking forward to watching their kids develop a strong sibling bond. "Just the fact that they'll, I mean hopefully, like each other. I like my sister, we were best friends," he said at the time of his twins' birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And that was the cool part growing up — I always had a best friend with me all the time," he continued. "I was never bored. That connection is super rare to have with a sibling when you're that close. It's just a really special relationship and I'm excited to see that play out with our kids."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-violet-betty></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Violet Betty</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lancebass/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bass and Turchin are the parents of daughter Violet Betty, their second child who was born via surrogate on Oct. 13, 2021.
