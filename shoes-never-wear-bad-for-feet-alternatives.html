<time>29 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>OUR shoes can put us at risk of some pretty painful foot problems, a podiatrist has warned.</p><p>But some footwear is significantly worse for us than others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RW-COMP-SHOES-podiatrist.jpg><p>Paul, who goes by @paulthepodiatrist on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, said the most important things to look out for are support, toe space and heel stability.</p><p>With that in mind, here he outlines three pairs he would never wear - and three to try instead.</p><h2>1. Flip flops</h2><p>First up is flip flops.</p><p>They might be handy to slip on when it's hot, but they pose several dangers, according to British podiatrist Paul, who is based at My FootDr in <a href=#>Singapore</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE HEALTH NEWS">READ MORE HEALTH NEWS</h2><p>He said: "When you put your foot through the loops, you have to grip and that can cause claw toeing.</p><p>"Also, when you're walking down the street, it's very easy to trip and fall when you're wearing them.</p><p>"They don't offer your feet any support."</p><p>Claw toe, similar to hammer toe, is a foot deformity often caused by wearing shoes that squeeze your toes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Usually, your toes are bent upward or downward, sometimes curling under, which can be incredibly painful.</p><p>Corns and calluses can form due to the pressure.</p><h2>2. Stilettos</h2><p>"The second pair of shoes I wouldn't wear are stilettos," Paul said.</p><p>"I don't want to hate on all heels because a one-and-a-half inch heel is okay for most people.</p><p>"But stilettos have such a thin base. My colleague actually fell recently and broke her foot.</p><p>"There's such a high risk of injury, is it worth it, even to look nice?"</p><h2>3. Skechers</h2><p>Paul's third choice is a brand that advertises itself as being big on "comfort and technology".</p><p>But there are three key reasons he's not a fan of Skechers.</p><p>"The first is that the slip-on variety are made tighter to hold on to your feet so can squeeze your toes and cause problems like neuromas," he said.</p><p>"The second is that they are so soft that your foot has to do more work.</p><p>"They may feel good but then later on through the day, then actually your foot is more tired.</p><p>"And the final thing is that the shoes just don't last long. They wear out so quickly.</p><p>"They may seem like a great deal but you're replacing your shoes every one to two months and I just don't think that's very good."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3-shoes-i-never-wear-823752073.jpg><p>After sharing his insight on what not to wear, Paul was inundated with messages asking which shoes are good for your feet.</p><p>He outlined three that he uses every single week.</p><h2>1. Bared smart shoe</h2><p>For meeting doctors and going to weddings, Paul loves the smart-looking Curium shoes from the brand Bared.</p><p>His favourite thing about it is that they have removable insoles, but he's also a fan of the amount of space they provide his tootsies.</p><p>"They also have very firm heel counters, which I love, and they have a bit of a toe drop so the heel is raised and then it drops off towards the toe," he added.</p><p>"That just takes the stress off the calf, off the Achilles, and prevents a lot of foot issues."</p><h2>2. Asics Kayano</h2><p>For day-to-day, Paul goes for Asics Kayanos.</p><p>They are designed as long-distance running shoes, but he wears them to work.</p><p>"I do most of my walking in these trainers," he said.</p><p>"The great thing about these shoes is they have got a very firm heel counter which locks the ankle in place.</p><p>"Then through the arch area, through the mid-foot, they have a lot of support as I have slightly flat feet."</p><p>Paul also loves the fact they lace up, and that they are pretty broad on the toes so avoids squeezing.</p><p>"I'd use this for longer walks, the gym, going for runs and things like that," he added.</p><h2>3. Nike Air Force 1</h2><p>"The final shoes for me are the Nike Air Force 1s," Paul said.</p><p>"These are great shoes for going to the mall, going for dinner, meeting my friends and things like that.</p><p>"They're best for when I do between 2,000 and 5,000 steps.</p><p>"The great thing is they are extra wide so they doesn't squash my feet.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"They're lace-ups again, and actually, the ankle stability comes up high above the ankle so they holds the foot in place nicely.</p><p>"These are great shoes and a fantastic addition to the wardrobe."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzfpVsZ3JsY2TAqbvErGSnnaaav27DxJqpZpqRmXqnu9FmnZ6dpGKurcDEq6WarJmrsrR7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bam-margera-placed-on-5150-psychiatric-hold-following-public-breakdown-suicide-threat.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bam-margera-placed-on-5150-psychiatric-hold-following-public-breakdown-suicide-threat.html>Bam Margera Placed on 5150 Psychiatric Hold Following Public Breakdown, Suicide Threat</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./drake-degrassi-throwback-jimmy-brooks-pic.html>Drake Shares Degrassi Throwback &amp;amp; Hes Unrecognizable See Pic Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./drake-degrassi-throwback-jimmy-brooks-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
