Regrettably, there is zero information when it comes to his parents. Aside from that, Grace is the only child of his parents.</p><p>Moving on, the 57-year-old attended Tustin High School, which is located in California. During his time at Tustin, Mark played baseball and basketball.</p><p>Thereafter, he joined the San Diego State University, where he gained a reputation for himself as one of the best young prospects.</p><h2>Mark Grace | Professional Career</h2><h3>MLB Career</h3><h4>Chicago Cubs</h4><p>When we talk about Mark‚Äôs career, it is nothing short of amazing. To emphasize, the 57-year-old started as a player then became a head coach before finally settling down as an analyst of the game. But, first, let‚Äôs take a glance at his playing career.</p><p>Grace started his professional career with the Chicago Cubs after the franchise drafted him in 1985. However, he spent the next three years developing the Cubs‚Äô farm system.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/grace-1072.jpg><p>After that, the North Carolina native spent 12 years with the Cubs, where he had the best moments of his career on a personal level. For instance, Mark became a three-time All-Star in 1993, 1995, and 1997.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney Esiason Bio: Wedding, Father, Net Worth, Age, Height, IG Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Besides, he also won the Gold Glove Awards four times in 1992, 1993, 1995, and 1996. Furthermore, he led his team to the NL wild card in 1998 and the NL East division title in 1989.</p><h4>Arizona Diamondbacks</h4><p>After his glorious 12 year stay, the 57-year-old decided to play for a new franchise to realize his dreams of winning the World Series. As a result, Grace signed with the Arizona Diamondback in a two-year contract in 2000.</p><p>Soon after, the first baseman realized his dreams by winning the World Series in 2001 by beating the world-renowned New York Yankees. After that, Mark stayed with the Diamondbacks for another two years before hanging up his boots in the fall of 2003.</p><h3>Coaching Career</h3><p>After retiring from his playing career, Mark had a short stint with the Diamondbacks as their hitting coach. However, the relationship lasted only for two years as he was let go from the job in 2016.</p><h3>Broadcasting Career (Marquee Network)</h3><p>Moving onto his broadcasting career, Grace worked as a color commentator for Fox Saturday Baseball from 2004 to 2012. Simultaneously, the 57-year-old also worked in various other roles with Fox Sports during that stint.</p><p><strong><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>If you are interested in buying Baseball jerseys, click here.>></a></strong></p><p>Due to unspecified reasons, Mark took an indefinite leave of absence, which lasted for five long years before returning as an analyst for Diamondback games by Fox Sports Arizona.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mark Grace is back üëè</p><p>No. 17 will join Marquee Sports Network as a Game Analyst! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JfbfYr1nK2</a></p><p>‚Äî Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) <a href=#>February 11, 2020</a></p><p>Subsequently, the North Carolina native worked at Fox Sports Arizona until February 2020, announced that Grace would be joining Marquee Sports Network as an analyst for select Chicago Cubs games.</p><h2>Mark Grace | Stats</h2><table><tbody><tr><td width=94>Year</td><td width=94>GP</td><td width=94>AB</td><td width=94>R</td><td width=94>H</td><td width=94>RBI</td><td width=94>BB</td><td width=94>SO</td><td width=94>HR</td><td width=94>SB</td></tr><tr><td width=94>Career</td><td width=94>2,245</td><td width=94>8,065</td><td width=94>1,179</td><td width=94>2,445</td><td width=94>1,146</td><td width=94>1,075</td><td width=94>642</td><td width=94>173</td><td width=94>70</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Mark Grace | Age, Height & Nationality</h2><p>Talking about Mark‚Äôs age, he is 57 years of age at the moment. Likewise, having been born on the 28th of June makes his star sign, Cancer. Moreover, some of the characteristics of Cancer include loyalty, affection, and sensitiveness, to name a few.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Belle Bio: Family, Career, Net Worth, Salary, Age, Trades Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Moving on, Grace stands at 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 200 lb. Furthermore, back in the days, the North Carolina native used to play as a first baseman. In fact, he was one of the premier first basemen of his generation with three All-Stars and a World Series to support that claim.</p><p>And, about his nationality, Mark‚Äôs parents gave birth to him in Winston-Salem, located in North Carolina. Hence, he is an American citizen.</p><h2>Mark Grace | Driving Under Influence</h2><p>The former MLB baseman has been arrested twice as he drove under the influence. Initially, he was arrested in May of 2011 for driving under the influence of alcohol.&nbsp;</p><p>The athlete was again arrested 15 months later in Scottsdale for the same reason. As a result, he was charged with felony endangerment and misdemeanor.&nbsp;</p><p>Grace admitted his guilt in the first case but pleaded not guilty for his second arrest.</p><p>Hence, the case went to trial, where the jury found him guilty of driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license and without a court-ordered interlock device.</p><p>On top of that, the former baseballer lost his job when the Arizona Diamondbacks relieved him of his broadcasting duties. However, Mark said that he did not blame the Diamondbacks for firing him.&nbsp;</p><p>As the former coach was found guilty, the judge sentenced him to four months in prison. After serving his time, he was compelled to install an interlock device in his car. He was also under supervised probation for two years.</p><h2>How much is Mark Grace Worth? Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2020, Mark has an eye-watering net worth of <strong>$25 million</strong> accrued mainly from his activities as a player, coach, and then broadcaster in the MLB.</p><p>Moreover, the 57-year-old started his foray into the MLB in 1988 and has been involved in one capacity or another ever since. Therefore, his massive net worth should come as no surprise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mark-Grace-Signed-Cubs-Jersey.jpg><p>Furthermore, Grace earned over <strong>$45 million</strong> during his 15-year long playing career, which is an extraordinary amount. In fact, if we take in the inflation rates over the years, then Mark would have earned over <strong>$100 million</strong> just on wages in today‚Äôs exchange rates.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karl Malone Net Worth: Bio, Contracts, Salary, House, Wife, Children Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Moving onto his coaching and broadcasting career, we could not find his coaching contract‚Äôs exact details with the Diamondbacks.</p><p>However, because Grace was such a good player, we believe that he must have earned millions. Regarding&nbsp;his salary as a broadcaster, Mark earns around <strong>$100,000 per year</strong> with the Marquee Network.</p><h2>Mark Grace | Wife & Kids</h2><p>Talking about Mark‚Äôs relationships is as eventful as his career because he has been married and divorced twice. Firstly, the 57-year-old married his then-girlfriend, <strong>Michelle Grace,</strong> in 1988.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/grace-1071.jpg><p>Subsequently, the duo stayed together for five years before breaking it all off in 1993. Unfortunately, the reason behind their split remains a mystery to the general public.</p><p><strong><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>If you are interested in buying Baseball boots, click here>></a></strong></p><p>However, the North Carolina native soon got back on his horse as he married <strong>Tanya Avila</strong> in 2002. The couple seemed happy for a while and even had two sons, <strong>Jackson Gene Grace</strong> and <strong>Preston Torre Grace</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, Jackson was born before the pair‚Äôs marriage in 2000, while Preston was born a year after their wedding in 2003.</p><p>Sadly, just like previously, Grace could not sustain his marriage as the two lovers got divorced in 2006. Nevertheless, Mark still visits his sons regularly as he wants his children to have a father figure in their lives.</p><h2>Mark Grace | Social Media Presence</h2><p>The baseball player is not active on social media platforms. Hence, he does not have a Twitter or an Instagram account.</p><p>Nevertheless, his analyst works are posted through Marquee Network‚Äôs <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a> handle. Moreover, the account has <strong>54.6 thousand</strong> followers.</p><h2>Common Queries:</h2><h3>Where is Mark Grace now?</h3><p>Currently, Mark works as a baseball analyst at Marquee Sports Network for&nbsp;select Chicago Cubs games.&nbsp;</p><h3>How many Gold Gloves did Mark Grace win?</h3><p>Mark Grace won four Golden Gloves in the entirety of his MLB career.
