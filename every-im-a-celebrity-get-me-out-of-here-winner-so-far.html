the Sneaky Snake Run (winning 2/6 stars), the spider web (winning 3/4) and the final trial with Tara, which he completed successfully.</p><h3>2003 – Phil Tuffnell</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000357675952-e1506952723744.jpg><p>England cricket player was the next king of the jungle after taking part in the show that ran for two weeks from late April, 2003.</p><p>The star took part in three challenges, but after two weeks in the show came dangerously close to leaving after falling down to the bottom three.</p><p>Thankfully he pulled himself back and was up against England footballer John Fashanu and Linda Barker in the final.</p><p>While Phil took home the win, John came second and Linda came third.<br></p><h3>Jan 2004 – Kerry Katona</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000357675899-e1506952752196.jpg><p>Atomic Kitten star Kerry Katona (then Kerry McFadden) got off to a shaky start on the show after only landing two stars during her first trial on day three.</p><p>By the final day, only Peter Andre and Jennie Bond remained with Kerry in the camp - and Kerry took home the champion title.</p><p>Though it wasn't all a loss for Peter, who came second, as he left with a new girlfriend, Katie Price - who would be his wife and mother of two of his children before they split in 2009.<br></p><h3>Winter 2004 – &nbsp;Joe Pasquale</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000357675893-e1506952851296.jpg><p>Comedian and presenter Joe Pasquale became the next king of the jungle after participating in four trials and winning the title from Princess Diana's right hand man, Paul Burrell.</p><p>At the time, he took part in the show's most expensive trial ever, the Hell-O-Copter, and won all eight stars in the process.</p><p>In another, he was trapped underground for a buried alive challenge which saw him covered in a host of animals including rats and being submerged in water.</p><p>He also got attached to two emus the camp were tasked with looking after, which he called Ant and Dec after the show's presenters, even when they pecked his glasses off.<br></p><h3>2005 – Carol Thatcher</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000357675892-e1506952915120.jpg><p>Carol, journalist daughter to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, reigned supreme in the 2005 series.</p><p>During her time on the show, she competed in five trials -

boyfriend and fellow king Joe Swash, who was presenting the spin-off show at the time and crowned her.<br></p><h3>2011 – Dougie Poynter</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000005056829-e1506953114281.jpg><p>Cheeky chappy Dougie proved himself to be a kind-hearted champ while in camp -
