He made his name as one of the pioneers of the new jack swing, which was billed as a mix of hip hop and R&B. He joined the R&B and pop group New Edition in 1978 before leaving in 1978.</p><p>Bodhi’s father released four studio albums with New Edition before going on to release five solo studio albums between 1986 and 2012. His acting career has also seen him appear in over a dozen movies and TV shows, the most recent of which was in 2021, when he played Crab in the American reality singing competition The Masked Singer.</p><h2>Bodhi Jameson Mother</h2><p>As previously stated, Bobby Brown’s second child with his second wife, Alicia, is Bodhi Jameson Rein Brown. Alicia Brown, who was born Alicia Catherine Etheredge in Culver City, California, on December 21, 1973, is also African American and works as a producer and manager.</p><p>Although the identity of Alicia’s parents is unknown, it is widely assumed that she grew up with a sister and a brother. Her sister Kim is the co-founder of the hair product line Mixed Chicks, and her brother Justin is said to work in the film industry.</p><p>Alicia, for her part, has produced several TV shows in her capacity as a producer, while as a manager, she has worked on the management teams of a number of celebrities, including retired NBA star Magic Johnson, R&B singer Macy Gray, and, of course, she has been her husband’s manager since before they married.</p><h2>Bodhi Jameson’s parents Relationship</h2><p>According to multiple sources, Bodhi’s parents married on June 19, 2012, in Hawaii. Before deciding to marry, the celebrity child’s parents reportedly knew each other as teenagers, and their friendship grew to the point where they were inseparable as friends over time.</p><p>According to multiple sources, Bodhi’s mother was present at her father’s first wedding in 1992. That was the last time they were seen together in public at an event. All of that would change nearly 16 years later, in 2008, when he asked her to join his management team.</p><p>It was as if time had stopped for the newlywed couple, who soon allowed their emotions to merge with their professional relationship and began seeing each other romantically.</p><p>Bodhi’s parents married in 2012 after becoming engaged in 2010. Their marriage has lasted more than a decade, and despite a slew of controversies, they are still together, and all signs point to the fact that they will be for the foreseeable future.</p><h2>Bodhi Jameson Rein Brown’s Siblings</h2><p>Bodhi Jameson grew up with two siblings, a brother, and a sister, as mentioned throughout this article.

Despite the over 7-year age difference between her and her older brother, her relationship with her siblings is nothing short of what you would expect from any other family with young children.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZqJyYnnqrrcyeqqimXaeyqrqMm6mor55k</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbodhi-jameson-rein-brown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbodhi-jameson-rein-brown.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbodhi-jameson-rein-brown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbodhi-jameson-rein-brown.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbodhi-jameson-rein-brown.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbodhi-jameson-rein-brown.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./emma-watson-sofia-vergara-transformation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./emma-watson-sofia-vergara-transformation.html>Emma Watson, Sofia Vergara Transformation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kate-caudwell-billionaire-john-caudwell-wife.html>Who is Kate McFarlane?
