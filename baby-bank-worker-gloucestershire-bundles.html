Nobody ever expects that they’ll have to ask for nappies.”</p><p>Stacey’s favourite part about volunteering at Gloucestershire Bundles is the breadth of help they provide - from furnishing an expectant mum’s flat to giving a new coat to a young child who ripped theirs at school.&nbsp;</p><p>The baby bank works exclusively on a referral basis through healthcare professionals and social services.</p><p>The small team has around six people volunteering on an average day but is always looking for more volunteers.</p><p>Stacey urged people to remember that those struggling and relying on baby banks are in your community - and they need whatever help you can offer, be it donations, fundraising, volunteering or money.</p><p>“It’s on everyone’s door step and this is why I think Fabulous’ Baby, Bank On Us campaign is so important,” she says.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“It opens people’s eyes.
