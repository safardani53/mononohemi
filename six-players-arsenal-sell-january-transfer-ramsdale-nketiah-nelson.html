Arsenal would rather sell now, but may be left with little choice if offers come in.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a aria-label="FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS AND BONUSES NEW CUSTOMERS (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS & NEW CUSTOMER BONUSES</a></strong></p><p>It could be seen as a gamble by Arteta, given Arsenal’s injury issues in that position, but <a href=#>Takehiro Tomiyasu</a> returned to action at Craven Cottage while <a href=#>Jurrien Timber</a> is expected to make his long-awaited comeback in mid-February.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>EDDIE NKETIAH</strong></h2><p>The future looked bright for the England striker when he <a href=#>signed a new long-term deal at Arsenal</a> in the summer of 2022 – taking on Thierry Henry’s famous No.14 shirt.</p><p>But since then, despite an impressive goal-to-game ratio – mainly from the bench – <a href=#>Nketiah</a> has struggled to convince Arteta he can lead the line for an entire season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/eddie-nketiah-arsenal-looks-premier-868662339.jpg><p>As it stands, Arteta wants to keep him at the club, a useful squad player who is currently Arsenal’s joint-top Prem scorer with five goals in ten starts so far.</p><p>There has been interest around the 24-year-old for some time now, and <a href=#>Crystal Palace are keeping tabs</a> this month on a potential move.</p><p>With his contract not expiring until 2027, Arsenal would be looking for an extraordinary offer to let Nketiah leave. Until then, he will remain in Arteta’s plans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>EMILE SMITH ROWE</strong></h2><p>Despite still having his minutes managed since coming back from injury, it was a surprise to see <a href=#>Smith Rowe</a> an unused sub as Arsenal pushed for an equaliser against Fulham.</p><p>During the early days of Arteta’s reign, he was one of catalysts for their upturn in form, providing goals, assists and energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-emile-smith-rowe-arsenal-868749048-1.jpg><p>But since his last new contract in July 2021, he has made 51 Prem appearances across three seasons, yet has made just one Prem start across the past two seasons.</p><p>He may be a fan favourite, but Arteta could see this as the time to cash in on a young player who still has potential to make his mark in this division.</p><p>Tied up until 2026, Arsenal will again be waiting for a significant offer before making a decision.</p><p><a href=#>Newcastle</a> have previously been interested but are only looking at loan deals with an obligation to buy during this window, and have their eyes on Manchester City’s Kalvin Phillips.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>AARON RAMSDALE</strong></h2><p>The player who more than most has his eyes on the exit door with the Euros approaching in the summer, having been ousted as No1 by the arrival of <a href=#>David Raya</a> in the summer.</p><p><a href=#>Ramsdale</a> was bought for £30m including add-ons from Sheffield United in the summer of 2021. His contract expires in 2026 with an option to extend until 2027.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/aaron-ramsdale-arsenal-looks-uefa-865895937.jpg><p>Arsenal will want to at least get back what they put in should he leave, but again, Arteta has been insistent in his desire for Ramsdale to fight for his place from the bench.</p><p>Yet Ramsdale knows his Three Lions chances are slipping away week by week. He has made just five Prem appearances this season, the last one coming in November.</p><p><a href=#>Chelsea</a> and Newcastle are keeping tabs on the situation, both clubs suffering from injuries to their first-choice keepers currently.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>JAKUB KIWIOR</strong></h2><p>The Polish defender only <a href=#>signed last January in a £20m five-and-a-half-year deal</a> from Italian outfit Spezia, but is already fighting to stay in North London.</p><p><a href=#>Kiwior</a> was axed at half-time against Fulham having struggled in an unfamiliar left-back role, just his eighth Prem appearance of the season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jakub-kiwior-arsenal-premier-league-869110037.jpg><p>Like Cedric, it would be a risk to sell him without bringing in a like-for-like given Arsenal’s injury worries at the back, as well as Kiwior’s flexibility in defence and holding midfield.</p><p>It could be a departure that makes sense given Tomiyasu, Timber and <a href=#>Thomas Partey</a> are all expected back within the next month.</p><p>However, Tomiyasu is set to join up with Japan for the Asian Cup and Kiwior may be needed as cover.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>REISS NELSON</strong></h2><p>One of Arteta’s most loyal servants and a player the Spanish coach still feels he can get more from, <a href=#>Nelson</a> has been on the periphery of the starting XI for some time.</p><p>The issue for the 24-year-old academy graduate is that he is attempting to break into a crowded position – one that already has Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-reiss-nelson-arsenal-premier-868749003.jpg><p>The four-year deal he signed back in July will help keep his price high should Arteta feel, like Smith Rowe’s situation, that now is the time to cash in and move on.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Again, it would be a risk to see a valued squad member depart. Wolves have been interested in the player in the past, and Nelson is sure to attract further Prem suitors.</p><p>For now, Arteta is happy with Nelson’s position in the squad, but his impact off the bench this season has been underwhelming at best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fpBuaWxpX6i2uXnPpZiynaKoeqK%2B0p6lmqRdqLKtuIyjmKetkafGbsDRmqWsnpWnerOtzKybmqSVYrussdOimKFlnpq5tLvNaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsix-players-arsenal-sell-january-transfer-ramsdale-nketiah-nelson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsix-players-arsenal-sell-january-transfer-ramsdale-nketiah-nelson.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsix-players-arsenal-sell-january-transfer-ramsdale-nketiah-nelson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsix-players-arsenal-sell-january-transfer-ramsdale-nketiah-nelson.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsix-players-arsenal-sell-january-transfer-ramsdale-nketiah-nelson.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsix-players-arsenal-sell-january-transfer-ramsdale-nketiah-nelson.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bob-esponja-un-h-roe-fuera-del-agua.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bob-esponja-un-h-roe-fuera-del-agua.html>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./90-day-fiance-paul-claims-a-man-is-posting-revenge-porn-of-karin.html>Paul Claims Man Posting Scandalous Pics of Karine</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./90-day-fiance-paul-claims-a-man-is-posting-revenge-porn-of-karin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
