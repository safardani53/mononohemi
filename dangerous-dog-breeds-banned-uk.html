They wanted a dog that would fight in sumo-style wrestling, and they developed this breed for that purpose.</p><p>Owing to Japanese dog fighting rules, the animals weren't allowed to make any noise in the pit so some of these dogs are said to have been able to fight in silence.</p><h3>Dogo Argentino</h3><p>The Argentine Dogo is a large, white, muscular breed of dog that was developed in Argentina.</p><p>Breeders wanted a dog that would exhibit steadfast bravery and willingly protect its human companion.</p><p>It became popular for dog fighting when they were brought to this country.</p><h3>Fila Brasileiro</h3><p>The Fila Brasileiro is a Brazilian breed&nbsp;of large&nbsp;working dog.</p><p>This large breed of dog is thought to have been developed in the 1400s in South America. It was bred to be a working farm dog, used to protect cattle and catch predators.</p><p>This breed is known to be stubborn, domineering and highly intelligent.</p><h3>XL Bully</h3><p>The XL Bully is the latest dog to be added to the dangerous dogs list.</p><p>The breed is banned in England and Wales and it is now illegal to breed, sell, advertise, exchange, gift, rehome, abandon or allow XL bully type dogs to stray.</p><p>If you currently have an XL bully type, you are required to keep your dog on a lead and muzzled when they are walked in public.</p><p>You’ll also need to apply for the government’s exemption scheme by January 31 2024 to get your dog exempted and comply with additional restrictions including having them neutered and having third party liability insurance.</p><p>From February 1 2024 it will be illegal to own an XL bully type without a certificate of exemption.</p><p>An American bully XL, known as an XL bully, is the largest of the American bully types.</p><p>They are not a registered breed with the Kennel Club in the UK and are a type of dog that has been bred from several different dog breeds.</p><h2>What is the Dangerous Dogs Act?</h2><p>After eleven horrific attacks in 1991, Home Secretary Kenneth Baker promised "to rid the country of the menace of these fighting dogs" by introducing the Dangerous Dogs Act.</p><p>The law is often considered controversial as it focuses on a dog's breed or looks instead of an individual dog's behaviour, and fails to stem the rise of dog attacks.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>RSPCA</a>, over a third of the people killed by dogs since the act was brought in were attacked by legal breeds.</p><h2>How is the Dangerous Dogs Act enforced?</h2><p>Under the <a href=# rel=noopener>Dangerous Dogs Act</a>, if a person owns a banned dog, the police or council are allowed to take it away and keep it regardless of whether or not it is acting dangerously or a complaint has been made.</p><p>If the animal is in a public place, they can simply be confiscated there and then - but in private, police must have a warrant to take the dog.</p><p>After it has been examined by an expert, the dog will either be kept in kennels while the police apply to the court or released.</p><p>Once in court, the owner has to prove the dog is not a banned breed and if successful, the dog will be returned.</p><p>But if the dog is deemed to be a dangerous type or the owner pleads guilty, they could face an unlimited fine or up to six months in prison as well as the dog being destroyed.</p><p>In some instances, the court may decide that although the dog is banned, it is not a danger to the public.</p><p>If you have bought a puppy you believe is a Pit Bull Terrier but the dog is friendly and "well socialised", you can speak to the&nbsp;Met police’s Status Dogs Unit.</p><p>If this happens, the owner will be given a Certificate of Exemption and the dog will be put on the national Index of Exempted Dogs.</p><p>The certificate is valid for the life of the dog but it must be neutered, microchipped, kept on a leash and muzzled in public and kept in a secure place.</p><p>The owner must also insure the dog against injuring other people and be more than 16 years old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoNzfY9raWickaO0pr7OrqpmnJ%2BceqO%2BxJ6brGWSlruvscNmrKRn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdangerous-dog-breeds-banned-uk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdangerous-dog-breeds-banned-uk.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdangerous-dog-breeds-banned-uk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdangerous-dog-breeds-banned-uk.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdangerous-dog-breeds-banned-uk.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdangerous-dog-breeds-banned-uk.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-dale-midkiff-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-dale-midkiff-dating.html>Who is Dale Midkiff Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./templegate-tote-placepot-tips-wincanton-saturday-january-06.html>Templegate's Tote Placepot tips with 150,000 guaranteed for Wincanton</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./templegate-tote-placepot-tips-wincanton-saturday-january-06.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
