I will always see him as my older brother.</p><p>"I've always just wanted my brave young brother to have some kind of legacy, the fact that he lost his life at 22 and in such a tragic manner. I just like him to have a place in peoples hearts."</p><p>While Spencer opened up about the emotional moment he heard his late brother's voice for the first time in 24 years.</p><p>He said: “Dave in particular brought to the table footage from the 1999 expedition of Mike and Dave climbing and Mike’s attitude to the mountain and I actually had never, prior to flying to Canada to meet Dave, had never seen Mike on camera ever.</p><p>“We weren’t the kind of family that made home videos and when I said to mum and dad, when we agreed to make this documentary, I said I need all footage of Mike and they said ‘We don’t have any’.</p><p>“Fortunately, Dave had this incredible film that I hadn’t seen so I saw it in Canada for the first time and it’s the first time I’d heard Michael speak since he was alive, since I was 10.”</p><p>Michael's body was left behind on the mountain’s chillingly named Death Zone at around 8,500 metres after he was caught in a storm.</p><p>The arduous journey was fraught with emotion, not only for Spencer but his family.</p><p>His mum Jane and sister Nina, speak for the first time publicly about losing Michael in the film.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In the film, Jane explains: “Mike was supposed to summit on the 13th and by the 14th we hadn’t heard anything.&nbsp;</p><p>“A storm had come in and Mike was missing. But it was too long after by then, I sort of knew that was it, he was dead. You don’t know if he’s fallen into a crevasse or over the edge or whether just from exhaustion sat down and collapsed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/9c9bfdeb-9bd3-4b7e-894d-ea2e28f32208.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSEdn%2BWcGtwZ6Olsq%2BvxKtkppmkqbWmw9Jmn56Zoqmvs7HApKCnn12ivK6xza1km6qfqbWmvoymoJygkZq5brDInpto</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fspencer-matthews-heartbreaking-moment-brother-michael-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fspencer-matthews-heartbreaking-moment-brother-michael-died.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fspencer-matthews-heartbreaking-moment-brother-michael-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fspencer-matthews-heartbreaking-moment-brother-michael-died.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fspencer-matthews-heartbreaking-moment-brother-michael-died.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fspencer-matthews-heartbreaking-moment-brother-michael-died.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./malcolm-agnew.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./malcolm-agnew.html>Fame | Malcolm Agnew net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./carrie-underwood-gets-matching-tattoos-with-mom-and-sisters-pic.html>Carrie Underwood Gets Matching Tattoos With Mom and Sisters: Pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./carrie-underwood-gets-matching-tattoos-with-mom-and-sisters-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
