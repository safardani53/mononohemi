<time>02 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>WHEN it’s hot outside there’s nothing nicer for your dog than a cool dip in a crystal clear pool – and the best dog paddling pools make this an easy and affordable summer treat.</p><p>When the weather is hot, dogs are prone to overheating and this can escalate to heatstroke (which in rare cases, can be fatal), so a paddling pool is a great way to help keep your dog safe in the heat. Splashing around in a paddling pool is also just great fun when it's just too hot to chase a ball.</p><p>When shopping for the best dog paddling pools, there are a few things to consider, including size and material.</p><p>For example, if you've got a puppy and not much outdoor space at home, you may only need the smallest paddling pool, but, if you buy a bigger model for your dog, the kids can even play in there too (though of course, it’s not likely to stay crystal clear for long!)</p><p>Look for pools that don't need inflating – children's inflatable pools will be easily punctured by your dog's teeth and claws, so you need to buy a pool made with materials designed to withstand canine play. Materials such as PVC with fibreboard panels inside for the body of the pool and toughened, non-slip PVC for the base are the best options for puncture-proof dog paddling pools.</p><p>Read on for our round-up of the best dog paddling pools to buy in the UK this summer.</p><h2>Best dog paddling pools at a glance:</h2><h2>Pecute Paddling Pool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Amazon-pecute-dog-paddling-pool.jpg><ul><li><strong>Pecute Paddling Pool for Pets, from £34.99 at Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Described by fans as "by far the best I have owned" when it comes to doggy pools, Pecute's design is a versatile choice that doubles as a kids' bath, paddling pool and storage basket.</p><p>It opens easily to assemble in minutes (with no inflating required), folds down for storage and even includes a handy storage bag for travelling.

It comes in a vibrant range of colours including green, purple and red.</p><p>Reviewers like that dogs can't puncture it, and that it's strong yet shallow. A dog paddling pool should always be shallow enough that your dog's head sits above the water when they are laying down, and with this pool being only 16cm tall, you don't have to worry too much about the water being too deep.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>16cm x 57cm, <strong>material</strong>: polyethylene, <strong>design:</strong> Not foldable</p><h2><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Fuloon Dog Paddling Pool&nbsp;</span></h2><li></li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-25.jpg><ul><li><strong><strong>Fuloon Foldable Dog Paddling Pool</strong></strong><strong><strong>, from</strong></strong><strong> £37.99</strong><strong><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large> at Amazon — <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p>This foldaway doggie paddling pool is available in three different stylish colour combinations and four sizes, so offers a great selection of options, whether you've got a small dog or several larger ones (or have children who want to use the pool as well).</p><p>With a non-slip interior, quick drain plug and sealed corners, the design is a versatile choice that also includes a storage bag for convenience and easy transportation.</p><p>Reviewers are impressed with the design, and some have also used it as a ball pit.

Don't sweat it. The fountain mat and outer layers are made from thickened PVC, so this pool is difficult to damage.</p><p>Available in two sizes (100cm and 150cm diameter), it's suitable for dogs of most sizes.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>100 x 100cm or 150 x 150cm, <strong>material</strong>: PVC, <strong>design:</strong> foldable</p><h2><strong>Best pool with leash retainer: Cool Club Dog Paddling Pool Blue</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7124711.jpg><ul><li><strong>Cool Club Dog Paddling Pool Blue, from £25 from PetsatHome - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Equipped with a galvanised spring steel frame, the Cool Club Dog Paddling Pool is a really durable find for a pooch who loves splashing around.</p><p>It's even got a leash retainer which is ideal if you have company and want to keep your dog under control.</p><p>Because it has a waterproof PU shell, it's really easy to clean. And even though it has a steel frame, there are no tools, sticks, poles or assembly required.</p><p>If you have a little dog, you can stick with the large version for £25. And if your dog is on the bigger side, size up and get the extra large version for £35.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>96 x 96 x 25cm or 122 x 122 x 30cm, <strong>material</strong>: PU and polyester, <strong>design:</strong> popup</p><h2>Splash Sprinkler Pool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-21-at-11.26.49.png><ul><li><strong>Splash Sprinkler Pool for Dogs and Kids, £26.58 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Sprinkler pools for dogs are rarely as versatile as this one. It has fun sprinklers for play time but is still deep enough to double up as a regular pool for your dog to relax in as well.</p><p>All you have to do is connect the splash pad connector to your hose, adjusting the water pressure to lower or raise the spray height. The pool is foldable and easy to transport too, which is ideal if you're taking your dog on holiday or visiting someone else's house this summer.</p><p>Although the PVC material is 0.5mm and thicker than your average pool, so unlikely to tear, the manufacturers recommend trimming your dog's nails before use.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>120 x 120 x 25 cm, <strong>material</strong>: PVC, <strong>design:</strong> foldable</p><h2>Rosewood Cool Down Dog Pool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-21-at-11.17.16.png><ul><li><strong>Rosewood Cool Down Foldable Dog Pool, from £28 at Pets at Home - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This pool is one of the most convenient of the bunch. When your dog is struggling in the hot weather, you want a quick solution. This pool doesn't need to be inflated, so you don't have to factor in the time and energy it normally takes to blow up an inflatable pool.</p><p>It's also great for holidays and spending time at friends' houses this summer, since not only is it foldable, but it comes in its own bag with handles for easy transportation.</p><p>Plus, this pool comes in three sizes: small, medium and large. So, whether you've got multiple dogs, one large one, or one little one, you can choose a size that best fits their needs.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>80 x 80 x 20cm, <strong>material</strong>: PVC, <strong>design:</strong> foldable</p><h2>What are dog paddling pools?</h2><p>It's exactly what you think it is. A small pool to install in your garden, made for your dog to bathe, swim and play in when the weather's warm.</p><p>Instead of the inflatable paddling pools you often find for kids, dog paddling pools are even easier to set up.</p><p>Typically made from scratch-proof PVC, the designs easily fold open and shut, can be transported with ease and don't require an air pump to assemble.</p><p>But that's not all. These paddling pools make excellent fun for children too, and can even double up as sandpits, ball pits and even baby baths. They also make ideal dog baths and a good place to brush your pooch down after a long walk.</p><p>Dog paddling pools aren't the only way to help pups from overheating in the warm weather: you'll also find <a href=# rel=noopener>cooling mats for dogs online, </a>which are typically gel-filled and pressure-activated to start cooling your pup once they step on it.</p><h2>Do dogs like paddling pools?</h2><p>Most dogs love to splash about in the water, so a paddling pool just for them will likely go down a treat.</p><p>Even if your dog isn't that much of a water baby, during the summer and warmer weather, a cool place to chill out will be welcomed by hot pooches.</p><h2>Are paddling pools good for dogs?</h2><p>Paddling pools are a good way for dogs to have fun and keep cool, but options that are not meant specifically for dogs may not be the best idea.</p><p>This is because dogs may scratch or burst some pools (particularly those aimed at young children). So, when buying a pool for your pup, it's always best to purchase one that is designed with dogs in mind..</p><h2><strong>How much do dog paddling pools cost?</strong></h2><p>The dog paddling pools in our roundup cost from £15 upwards, but of course price varies. Small pools cost less than large versions and you will need to be guided by the size of your dog when choosing which one to buy.</p><p>Don’t be tempted to buy an inflatable child’s paddling pool though as your dog will likely put a hole in it with his teeth or claws while playing and replacing it will cost more in the long run.</p><p>Look on it as an investment that should last longer than one summer. The best dog paddling pools are another way to help keep your pooch cool during hot weather – along with walking them during the coolest times of the day, supplying plenty of water to keep them hydrated and providing a cooling mat to rest on.</p><h2><strong>Where to buy dog paddling pools in the UK</strong></h2><p>Puncture-proof paddling pools for dogs have grown in popularity in recent years so you shouldn’t have problems finding them online or in town, even supermarkets stock them during the summer months.</p><p>We found the dog paddling pools in our roundup at:</p><h2>What to look for in a dog paddling pool</h2><p>When choosing a dog paddling pool, make sure you're buying one that is the right size for your dog, as well as the space you have available.</p><p>It's also best to buy pools that are specifically meant for pets, rather than people (although people can use pet paddling pools, too!). This is because pet pools are generally more durable.</p><p>If your pooch is particularly rambunctious, it may also be worth spending out a little bit more on a more heavy-duty option to avoid any breaks or bursts.</p><p>There are many different colour options and sizes available and some dog paddling pools even easily fold away for storage purposes.
