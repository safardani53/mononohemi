But this was during a time when interracial relationships were frowned upon, so their union was criticized heavily. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite the harassment and racial abuse they faced, Doc Rivers and his wife bravely dealt with it and got married.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Is Doc Rivers Still Married?</h2><p>But in January 2020, the head coach for the <a href=# rel=follow>Los Angeles Clippers</a> was hit with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">infidelity</a> rumors.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>It was reported that Rivers was on a dinner date with a&nbsp;mystery brunette at San Vicente Bungalow in West Hollywood. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The woman placed her head on his shoulder while he lovingly wrapped his arm around her waist as they waited for the valet.</p><p>Rivers and Campion did not comment on the reports. However,&nbsp;it was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> the two had been living apart for the past five years and were currently in the middle of a divorce.</p><p>So, is Doc Rivers divorced? Well, the couple is yet to make an official confirmation on that one.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>How Many Kids Does Doc Rivers Have?</h2><p>The answer to that is that Rivers and Campion have&nbsp;four children, Jeremiah, Austin, Spencer, and Callie, who followed their father’s footsteps and became athletes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Jeremiah, their oldest son, played college ball at Georgetown University and Indiana University and then played in the NBA D-League for the Maine Red Claws.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Austin, their second son, played for the Los Angeles Clippers between 2015-2018. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Rivers became the first father to coach a son in the NBA, and while fans expected the two of them to have a special relationship, Austin painted a different picture.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ESPN</a>, he revealed&nbsp;that his father did not share his life outside of basketball with him, and the two only knew each other strictly through basketball.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>People think we have a relationship like every other father and son. We just don’t. That’s because he’s been gone my whole life, and that’s fine.</p><p>After playing for the Los Angeles Clippers, Austin was eventually traded to the Washington Wizards and then to the Houston Rockets.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Currently, he plays for the Denver Nuggets. Meanwhile, River’s third son, Spencer, played for Winter Park High School and UC Irvine.</p><h2>Doc Rivers' Daughter Married Seth Curry&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Callie</a>, Rivers’&nbsp;only daughter, is&nbsp;an athlete who played volleyball for the University of Florida and, after graduating, played professionally overseas.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Rivers’&nbsp;daughter also brought two of the NBA’s most well-known and successful families together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On September 14, 2019, she married into another famous basketball family when she wed Dell Curry’s son and Stephen Curry’s younger brother, Seth Curry. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Seth is also an NBA player and currently plays for the <a href=# rel=follow>Philadelphia 76ers</a>, where his father-in-law serves as a coach.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Undefeated</a>, Austin shared that he was initially skeptical when he heard his sister was dating an NBA player. But when he found out it was Seth Curry, he was thrilled.&nbsp;</p><p>NBA players travel a lot. There is a reputation. You don’t want your sister to get hurt. But when I heard it was Seth, I was relieved because he is one of the guys that act the right way.</p><p>These days Rivers is busy juggling his role as a coach and a grandfather.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnlKSwbr7Ir5yrq12stqexjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzesetpKU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoc-rivers-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoc-rivers-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoc-rivers-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoc-rivers-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoc-rivers-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoc-rivers-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dawn-lyen-gardner-husband-children.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dawn-lyen-gardner-husband-children.html>Know If Dawn-Lyen Gardner Has A Husband Or Children</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./larry-spriggs.html>Fame | Larry Spriggs net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./larry-spriggs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
