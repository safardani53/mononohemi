She was born on Aug. 28, 1994, when June was 15. Her father is June's ex-boyfriend David Dunn, who never joined the family on reality TV.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anna and June's relationship had been strained since 2003, when Anna moved out of her mother's house and in with her grandmother after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>surviving assault from her mother's then-boyfriend</a>, registered sex offender Mark McDaniel. In 2014, she told PEOPLE that McDaniel "would try and touch me and all that stuff" when she was 8 years old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, 'I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?'

Kaitlyn's biological father is unknown. Two years after her daughter's arrival, Anna married her boyfriend Michael Cardwell, in 2014. The pair went on to welcome a daughter together, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kylee Madison</a>, in 2015. Anna and Michael ultimately separated in 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Anna sued her mother for allegedly unpaid appearances on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, for which she claimed she and her daughter Kaitlyn were owed $300,000. The mother-daughter pair had remained largely estranged in the years since, though they did reunite for Shannon's February 2023 nuptials.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All four of my girls walked me down</a> to Justin and his mom walked him down the aisle," Shannon told PEOPLE of the big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As of 2023, Anna worked at a car dealership, the Five Star Toyota of Milledgeville, Georgia, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she posted about frequently</a> on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On March 30, 2023, PEOPLE confirmed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Anna had been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer</a>.
