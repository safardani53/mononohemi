The intimate wedding was a traditional Mayan ceremony, an homage to Marysol's late mother, Elsa, who died in 2019. Elsa was extremely spiritual and referred to herself as a seer, not a <a href=#>psychic</a>. An anonymous source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> that, "[Marysol] felt her mom’s influence guided her to have this kind of ceremony — Elsa is still in charge!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Steve is the president of Anzac Contractors which, according to his Instagram bio, "specializes in highway heavy construction and bridges." Also on his Instagram are several pictures of Steve with two young boys who appear to be his children. Under one photo, someone commented "Fantastic picture of the handsome McNamara gents! Congratulations boys and dad!" It looks like Marysol is a new stepmom as well as a new bride.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@stevemcnamara_</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Marysol and her ex-husband get a divorce?</h2><p>Marysol and her now ex-husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippe Pautesta-Herder</a> were married during Season 1 of The Real Housewives of Miami, and their marriage was essentially only one season long. While Marysol's mother Elsa seemed to really love Philippe, it just wasn't a good fit for Marysol. Fans were particularly invested in their relationship as they watched them meet, then go from partners to husband and wife.</p><p>Days after Philippe proposed to Marysol, they were married in Aspen in March 2010. During an episode of RHOM in 2012, Marysol announced that she was going to divorce Philippe. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebuzz</a> that, "I was really, really, really sad the whole time we were filming. I was an emotional wreck. My father was sick. My parents had just separated ... I was running my company ... I was just an emotional mess, but I tried."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Marysol Patton, also a TOP TIER housewife. Ugh so glad Miami is back <a href=#>#RHOM</a></p>— Kristina (@dumb_birdDee) <a href=#>December 17, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@dumb_birdDee</span></figure><p>In what can only be described as prophetic, Marysol also revealed to the outlet that she would like her next husband to be in his fifties. Her first husband was two years younger than her, and Philippe was 10 years her junior. Well, Steve is definitely in his fifties. Marysol also went on to say she would like to marry someone who already has children. "I haven’t had children. I would really like to have a child. I probably can’t have one on my own, but I would like to adopt." Steve has two sons!</p><p>It would appear that Marysol has finally found her perfect match. Hopefully, we'll get to see more of her in Season 4 of The Real Housewives of Miami. As of now, we don't know if she is still just a friend of the housewives, or if she's back to full housewife status. More will be revealed!</p><p>Season 4 of The Real Housewives of Miami is streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zxdKoo2aokanBsLqMoaysmpGjsQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarysol-patton-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarysol-patton-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarysol-patton-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarysol-patton-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarysol-patton-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarysol-patton-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-mitchell-wick-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-mitchell-wick-dating.html>Who is Mitchell Wick Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eiza-gonzalez-kissing-liam-hemsworth.html>Eiza Gonzalez Kissing Liam Hemsworth!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eiza-gonzalez-kissing-liam-hemsworth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
