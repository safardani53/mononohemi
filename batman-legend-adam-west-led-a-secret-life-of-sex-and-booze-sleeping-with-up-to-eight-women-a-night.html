<time>28 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>HOLY family viewing, Batman – it turns out the Caped Crusader’s fetching satin pants spent a lot of time on the floor.</p><p>Adam West, <a href=#>who died on Saturday aged 88</a>, became a TV legend for his camped-up portrayal of the hero in the Sixties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330537038.jpg><p>But behind the batmask was a sex-mad actor who slept with up to EIGHT women a night — and turned to booze when the show was axed.</p><p>He and co-star Burt Ward, who played sidekick Robin, also romped with eager groupies in their dressing rooms in between scenes.</p><p>In fact West discovered the only limits to his bedroom batpowers were those caused by his famous costume.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict0003305296481-e1497211035742.jpg><p>The actor explained years later: “Because of the physical limitations of the costume, you gotta have quickies.”</p><p>And he had an awful lot of them, as well as dates with fellow stars including actress sisters Natalie and Lana Wood, and Raquel Welch.</p><p>West explained: “Burt and I were like kids in a candy store. It was the Swinging Sixties with free love and women threw themselves at us.</p><p>“I remember one night with eight different women. Orgy is a harsh word, but it was eight at one time.</p><p>“I’d have young female co-stars in my dressing room at 7.45 in the morning.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000001467917.jpg><p>In fact, West did once turn up at what he did describe as an “orgy” in Hollywood with Frank Gorshin, who played Batman baddie The Riddler.</p><p>But they were thrown out for behaving like their TV alter-egos and making everyone laugh.</p><p>He said: “We walked in and it was an orgy. So I immediately went into the Batman character, and Frank went into the Riddler character, because we were getting the big giggles.</p><p>“It was so funny to us, what we walked into. And we were kicked out. We were expelled from the orgy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330713619-e1497211231690.jpg><p>Meanwhile trusty Boy Wonder Ward, who is now 71, claimed West was definitely the ringleader when it came to their own adventures.</p><p>He recalled decades later: “When I entered Batman as a naive 20-year-old who had only dated a couple of girls, I met Adam West, who immediately introduced me to the wildest sexual debauchery that you can imagine.</p><p>“We often found that women were banging on our windows while we were bedded down with other women.”</p><p>He added: “We’re talking about wild times in the dressing rooms, on the set, between the shots, in the lunch wagon.</p><p>“And then of course, doing the personal appearances on the weekend, that’s where it really got wild.</p><p>“And I have to be honest with you, we became like sexual vampires.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330536993.jpg><p>He added that the costumes seem to be part of the lure for women, revealing: “If you look at our show, you’ll see that we always stood with our legs open our fists on hips and our bat bulges forward, which had a profound effect on women.”</p><p>West was 37 years old and twice-divorced when he was offered the role that would define his life.</p><p>After years of small roles, he was deemed to be Batman material after bosses saw him playing a 007-type spy in a Nesquik advert.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330698190.jpg><p>When the show hit screens in 1966 he and Ward became overnight sensations, in what was the most expensive show on television at the time.</p><p>It was also one of the funniest, with its surreal double entendres.</p><p>In a BBC interview in tribute to his late friend, Ward said: “We were playing it on multiple levels, we were playing with our audience.</p><p>“For the kids it was serious hero worship, for the adults it’s the nostalgia, the comic book, and for that very difficult audience at that time to capture, the teenagers and the college kids, it was the insinuations, the double entendres, all the things that nobody had ever done with an audience.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330698176.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330697705.jpg><p>But in 1968, after just three seasons and 120 episodes, Batman was defeated by the most fearsome breed of arch-villains — bean counters.</p><p>The show was axed, its ratings dropped and deals with other stations fell through.</p><p>For West, being famous for wearing his underpants on the outside and for his joyous sense of kitsch, did not translate into new job offers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330706808.jpg><p>One exception, incredibly, was an offer in 1970 to take over from<a href=#> Sean Connery as the new James Bond</a>.</p><p>But he turned down the role because he believed that the secret agent should be British.</p><p>It was a mistake. Despite a few bit-parts he soon found himself reduced to appearing in safety adverts and schlepping round for paid personal appearances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330706873.jpg><p>The lowest point was being fired out of a cannon at a carnival in Indiana dressed in his famous outfit.</p><p>West said later: “I was doing things I wasn’t very comfortable doing. I became very self-destructive.</p><p>“That came from being disillusioned and frustrated. I was bitter when I realised Batman had caused me to lose a lot of roles afterwards.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330771288.jpg><p>He turned increasingly to booze, triggering behaviour so bad that he was even barred from the posh ski resort of Aspen, Colorado, for life.</p><p>Heavy drinking even almost ruined a meeting with Pope Paul VI.</p><p>West recalled the morning he was to meet the Pontiff: “I woke up with the worst hangover of my life.</p><p>“I made it to the Vatican, and I was at the back of this line of people who each knelt down to kiss his ring.</p><p>“Then it was my turn. He put out his hand. I realised that, if I knelt down, I wouldn’t be able to get up again, I was so hung over.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330537035.jpg><p>Rather than kneeling he bowed his head. At this point the starstruck Pope cried: “Oh, Signor West. I have seen all of your shows.”</p><p>His fall from grace also led to depression — something that, along with alcoholism, ran in his family.</p><p>The young West, born Billy West Anderson, had a troubled upbringing in rural Walla Walla, in Washington State.</p><p>His opera singer mum Audrey had given up her career when she married West’s farmer dad Otto and regretted it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330541901.jpg><p>She became an alcoholic, and when West was 12 he found her in bed with the local preacher.</p><p>One of West’s six children, daughter Nina, once said of Audrey: “There is a curse running through our family. Alcohol and manic depression. That’s what she suffered from.”</p><p>By the time West was 15 his parents had divorced and he was living in Seattle with him mum.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict0003305298601-e1497212199678.jpg><p>At 22, he wed Billie Lou Yeager, but they divorced after six years. In 1957 he wed second wife Ngahra Frisbie. That marriage ended in 1962.</p><p>It was only in 1970, when he married Marcelle Tagland Lear, that he found lasting love. They remained together until his death.</p><p>And over time the actor, who amassed a £20million fortune from re-run fees and personal appearances, also came to terms with being known “only” as Batman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330544622.jpg><p>He even starred in 2003 TV movie spin-off Return To The Batcave with Burt Ward and a host of former co-stars.</p><p>He explained: “I decided that since so many people love Batman, I might as well love it too. So I began to re-engage myself with Batman.</p><p>“And I saw the comedy. I saw the love people had for it, and I just embraced it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330537032.jpg><h2>BRILLIANT BATTINESS</h2><p>ADAM WEST’S chief superpower was the ability to stay po-faced while delivering some of the most surreal and silly lines in TV history. Here are ten of his best.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> “It’s sometimes difficult to think clearly when you’re strapped to a printing press.”</p><p><strong>2.</strong> “It is the duty of every good citizen of Gotham City to report meeting a man from Mars in a public park.”</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Miss Kitka (Catwoman in disguise): “When I close my eyes, I imagine a world at peace.”</p><p>Batman: “That’s strange...when I close my eyes, I imagine something quite astonishingly different.”</p><p><strong>4.</strong> “No use, Joker! I knew you’d employ your sneezing powder, so I took an anti-allergy pill! Instead of a sneeze, I’ve caught your ...cold!”</p><p><strong>5.</strong> “It’s obvious. Only a criminal would disguise himself as a licensed, bonded guard yet callously park in front of a fire hydrant.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330771328.jpg><p><strong>6.</strong> Robin: “Where’d you get a live fish, Batman?”</p><p>Batman: “The true crimefighter always carries everything he needs in his utility belt, Robin.”</p><p><strong>7.</strong> To Robin: “Stop fiddling with that atomic pile and come down here!”</p><p><strong>8.</strong> About to cross a street: “Remember Robin, always look both ways.”</p><p><strong>9.</strong> “Hieroglyphics self-taught are a chore, Robin. But it is a sure-fire way to unravel the secrets of the ancient mystics.”</p><p><strong>10.</strong> “Salt and corrosion. The infamous old enemies of the crimefighter.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhrZ2yDeH%2BPaJmarJ2Wu264xKCcp5xdlrGiuYywnKysXaGypXnAZqqem6KawW64yJ%2BcZqeWYsCmxIyapZ1lkqS8u7GMrKOenaCeu6h51qKroWWlpXq1u4yeoKCgpGLEsLnEp2SaZZ6etKnAjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbatman-legend-adam-west-led-a-secret-life-of-sex-and-booze-sleeping-with-up-to-eight-women-a-night.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbatman-legend-adam-west-led-a-secret-life-of-sex-and-booze-sleeping-with-up-to-eight-women-a-night.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbatman-legend-adam-west-led-a-secret-life-of-sex-and-booze-sleeping-with-up-to-eight-women-a-night.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbatman-legend-adam-west-led-a-secret-life-of-sex-and-booze-sleeping-with-up-to-eight-women-a-night.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbatman-legend-adam-west-led-a-secret-life-of-sex-and-booze-sleeping-with-up-to-eight-women-a-night.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbatman-legend-adam-west-led-a-secret-life-of-sex-and-booze-sleeping-with-up-to-eight-women-a-night.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./celebrity-adoptions-2010911.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./celebrity-adoptions-2010911.html>Celebrities Who Have Adopted Children: Family Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-did-freaknik-end.html>Why and When Did the Atlanta Block Party Freaknik End?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-did-freaknik-end.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
