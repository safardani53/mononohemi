<time>25 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>EVERYONE in racing wants to have their cake and eat it.</strong></p><p>And sweet-toothed <a href=# rel=noopener>Fergal O’Brien</a> is not wasting a crumb.</p><p>The Cotswolds trainer is on course to shatter his previous best season.</p><p>He’s already notched 44 winners at a healthy 20 per cent strike-rate. There’s still more than three months of the season left and O’Brien needs just four winners to top his previous best haul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pa-21902400jpg-js162139408.jpg><p><strong>Colin’s Sister</strong> has rattled up a hat-trick of wins and there has been plenty of success in decent races with the likes of <strong>Viva Steve</strong>, <strong>Master Dee</strong> and <strong>Druid’s Folly</strong>.</p><p>The future also looks bright as ten of the wins have come in bumpers from just 36 runs.</p><p>It’s a stable cooking on gas. And it’s all fuelled by cake.</p><p>The Great O’Brien Bake Off has been keeping the staff stocked up on sumptuous sponges and gorgeous gateaux.</p><p>O’Brien, 44, explained: “Someone brought a cake one day and it just took off.</p><p>“If people ring up asking if they can see the horses on the gallops, we’ll say yes but you’ve got to bake a cake. They have to be homemade.</p><p>“Every Saturday we’ll have cakes — anything between two and six. We had eight once.</p><p>“We all love cake, who doesn’t? We get a lot of owners come to see their horses and I think they feel pressurised into baking a cake.</p><p>“My two daughters come and stay with me every Wednesday night and that was our ritual, watching the Bake Off on telly.”</p><p>It’s unclear if the treats have helped with the large slice of success. But it can’t have done any harm as O’Brien sits in 17th in the trainers’ table — far closer to the golden crust than the soggy bottom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/getty_cheltenham-races_spo_gyi628721428jpg-js287896546-e1484930594274.jpg><p>It comes just 18 months after he moved from his base just off the historic Fosse Way near Northleach to a place down the road he knows well.</p><p>He spent 18 years with <a href=#>Nigel Twiston-Davies</a> and now his old boss is his landlord.</p><p>He trains just across the road from Twiston-Davies, high above the Naunton Valley in a hot-bed of jumps racing.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jonjo O’Neill</a>, Kim Bailey, Ben Pauling and Martin Keighley are all little more than a light canter away.</p><p>O’Brien, a Victoria sponge fan, &nbsp;said: “We came back in July 2015 and from day one it was like coming home. Our first runner won even though we’d only been here a week. It’s just grown from there.</p><p>“We know the place so well so it was easy to fit back in.</p><p>“Our first season back here was pretty good. We had 35 winners. That gave us the power to go and buy some nice horses.”</p><p>O’Brien is not the only one in familiar surroundings. Head lad Kevin Brown, partial to a cream cake, spent 12 years working for Twiston-Davies and racing secretary Ally Stirling was there for four years.</p><p>Business partner Chris Coley, a fan of lemon drizzle, has horses in both yards.</p><p>Ex-trainer and chocolate brownie lover Sally Randell, O’Brien’s partner, came in the summer as assistant trainer.</p><p>Main jockey Paddy Brennan has become a bigger part of the O’Brien team after Tom George took Adrian Heskin on in the summer.</p><p>O’Brien said: “Paddy’s been great. He is riding as well as ever and is always looking at races. He’s very involved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pa-16336968jpg-js162139407.jpg><p>“The great thing about Paddy &nbsp;is the feedback. We’ve got a very honest relationship.”</p><p>The pair have plenty to look forward to, especially in the next few months.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Dual Cheltenham scorer <strong>Perfect Candidate</strong> is the stable’s first Gold Cup entry</a>.</p><p>O’Brien said: “He runs well round Cheltenham. If it ended up being six or seven runners we would be kicking ourselves.</p><p>“He’ll also be entered in the National. That would be my aim but the owners Geoff and Donna Keeys would prefer to go to Cheltenham.</p><p>“<strong>Alvarado</strong> has been a great horse for us. He ran a blinder first time out at Cheltenham when he finished sixth. Then he went to the Becher Chase and fell at the second.</p><p>“We’re going to try him in the cross-country race.</p><p>“We need to find a novice hurdle for <strong>Global Stage</strong>. I’d like to think he would be able to go &nbsp;for the Albert Bartlett or the Neptune. He’s a brute.</p><p>“I was impressed with the way he jumped and laid up and was still there turning in in the Tolworth when fourth.</p><p>“Colin’s Sister will have a couple of entries in the David Nicholson Mares’ Hurdle and the novices’ hurdles.”</p><p>There are others. Barney Dwan must have broken a mirror at some point. He has been unlucky not to win in three races this season and has the Pertemps as his aim.</p><p>Then there’s <strong>Wizard’s Sliabh</strong>. She won a bumper and her hurdles debut but has attracted attention for other reasons, &nbsp;especially from those without the cleanest of minds.</p><p>O’Brien chuckled: “You’ve got to pronounce it right. We have a very good man who does the social media, Simon Gillson. He is involved in a few horses, he named her.</p><p>“I had a call from Nick Luck. He said ‘I’ve just opened the paper and I can’t stop laughing’.</p><p>“Sliabh is Gaelic for mountain so we’re fully covered but I think the BHA will scrutinise our names from now on.”</p><p>Fergal O’Brien is a name punters should take note of. A tenner on all of his runners this season would have returned a tasty £570.</p><p>If he could bag a winner on jump racing’s greatest stage it really would be the cherry on top of a great season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cH6Vb21waWZksKmxy62cp6CRonqnsdKtoK%2BZnGKzpr7GmqNmp5Kntqa6jKisraSZo7K0ecWeqq2hppa5brzLmqWsZZakv26%2FzqacZqeWYrWqv4ysq5qanJp6tMDAq6pmoZ6YubawyKeeZpmcq66zrcOoZLCgn2KwsMHLnWShmaaaeqJ5wqGYp5%2BVYrynedKcnKedoq58</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcheltenham-festival-fergal-obrien-outlines-festival-plans-for-some-of-his-stable-stars-including-alvarado-who-could-have-a-change-of-scenery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcheltenham-festival-fergal-obrien-outlines-festival-plans-for-some-of-his-stable-stars-including-alvarado-who-could-have-a-change-of-scenery.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcheltenham-festival-fergal-obrien-outlines-festival-plans-for-some-of-his-stable-stars-including-alvarado-who-could-have-a-change-of-scenery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcheltenham-festival-fergal-obrien-outlines-festival-plans-for-some-of-his-stable-stars-including-alvarado-who-could-have-a-change-of-scenery.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcheltenham-festival-fergal-obrien-outlines-festival-plans-for-some-of-his-stable-stars-including-alvarado-who-could-have-a-change-of-scenery.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcheltenham-festival-fergal-obrien-outlines-festival-plans-for-some-of-his-stable-stars-including-alvarado-who-could-have-a-change-of-scenery.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marcelo-rebelo-de-sousa.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marcelo-rebelo-de-sousa.html>Fame | Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./phil-taylor.html>All About Darts Player, Phil Taylor [2023 Update]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./phil-taylor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
