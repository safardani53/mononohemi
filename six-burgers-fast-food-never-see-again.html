<time>16 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>THERE are at least six burgers that have been discontinued at several fast food giants over the years.</p><p><a href=#>McDonald's,</a> <a href=#>Wendy's</a>, <a href=#>Burger King</a>, <a href=#>Hardee's</a>, and several other chains attempted to change up their <a href=#>burger options</a> at one point or another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000811959367.jpg><p>Some staple patty meals like the <a href=#>Big Mac</a> or The Whopper have stood the test of time, sending other burger options flying off the grill and customers' hands.</p><p>Despite the well-intentioned reasoning behind the fresh burger idea's introduction to the public, customers didn't always respond â€” at least most of them.</p><p>Others have taken to <a href=#>social media</a> to claim that a now-discontinued option at their frequented fast food chain was their favorite burger the <a href=#>restaurant</a> ever offered.</p><p>Sadly, those few supporters of long-lost burgers will likely never see them again.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Fast Food">Read More on Fast Food</h2><h2>1. MUSHROOM SWISS BURGER</h2><p>First on the list of tragically axed burgers is McDonald's <a href=#>Mushroom Swiss Burger.</a></p><p>The <a href=#>fan-favorite</a> burger&nbsp;was part of the fast food giant's Signature Crafted Recipes line.</p><p>It stayed on the McDonald's menu for a while before the company decided to move away from craft burgers altogether in 2019.</p><p>One fan took to a <a href=#>Reddit</a> thread to profess their love for the discontinued sandwich.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>"Life hasn't been the same since Mcdonald's took my favorite burger away," the devastated customer wrote.</p><h2>2. STACKERS</h2><p>Burger King's Stackers <a href=#>hit their menu in 2006</a> and quickly became a favorite.</p><p>Stackers were offered in three sizes: single, double, and triple.</p><p>The burgers weren't craft and included meat, cheese, and bacon, among other standard condiments.</p><p>The flavor was there and more than enjoyable for <a href=#>the prices</a> of one dollar for the single, two for the double, and three for the triple.</p><p>After Stackers left, some fans were so upset that they swore they'd stop eating at Burger King for good.</p><p>"Burger King discontinued the stacker, looks like I'm never eating there again," a person on <a href=#>Twitter</a> posted.</p><p>In early 2023, Burger King added Stackers back once more for a short time before quietly removing it.</p><h2>3. BEYOND THICKBURGER</h2><p>In 2019, like many <a href=#>fast food</a> chains, Hardee's made the move toward meatless burgers, per <a href=# aria-label="Best Life (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Life</a>.</p><p>The Beyond Thickburger was introduced as a solid effort for the company to offer <a href=#>plant-based options</a>.</p><p>Hardee's even partnered <a href=# aria-label="with Beyond Meat (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Beyond Meat</a> to make the product and was only one of four items to do so in partnership with the company.</p><p>In a quiet process from that point until 2023, Hardee's removed all plant-based options from its menu and shifted focus to chicken and Angus beef.</p><p>It's unclear exactly what led to this, but it likely didn't get the customer attention the fast food chain thought it would.</p><h2>4. BACON AND BLUE BURGER</h2><p>Wendy's also experimented with craft burgers during the 2010s.</p><p>In fact, it became the first national fast food chain to add blue cheese to a burger with its Bacon and Blue Burger.</p><p>Soon after, <a href=#>the sandwich</a> was improved upon further with a brioche bun, this time smothered in blue cheese and a blue cheese aioli.</p><p>The burger vanished in 2015 from Wendy's menu unexpectedly.</p><p>It hasn't been brought back since, not even for a limited time, per <a href=# aria-label="HuffPost (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">HuffPost</a>.</p><h2>5. THE BEEFER</h2><p>Arguably one of the most notable and bold attempts at a fast food burger came from none other than <a href=#>Taco Bell</a>.</p><p>It was a sort of Sloppy-Joe and burger combination called the Beefer and featured taco meat with diced onions and shredded lettuce between two buns.</p><p>The taco burger was introduced to customers sometime back in the '70s and stayed on the menu for 20 years before it was removed.</p><p>Several fans who had the burger claim they still miss it even now.</p><h2>6. MINI SIRLOIN BURGERS</h2><p>Similar to what Burger King did with their Burger Shots, Jack in the Box also attempted to sell burger sliders in the mid-2000s.</p><p>This came in the form of the fast food chain's Mini Sirloin Burgers.</p><p>Three of the mini-burgers came in a meal and were topped with American cheese, grilled onions, and ketchup.</p><p>However, poor sales performance led to the <a href=# aria-label="sliders' downfall in 2011 (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sliders' downfall in 2011</a>, and they haven't been seen since.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>For more fast food content, check out The U.S. Sun's coverage of five McDonald's changes <a href=#>coming this spring that have customers excited</a>.</p><p>The U.S. Sun also has the story on how Wendy's is currently offering major <a href=#>"mercury" deals on fan-favorite menu items.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/six-burgers-fast-food-joints-811959452.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIZ1fJZtb2irma16o8HRoJyrq12brrTAjJ%2BmqJxdo7K3sdFmqp6dXZa0orXNaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsix-burgers-fast-food-never-see-again.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsix-burgers-fast-food-never-see-again.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsix-burgers-fast-food-never-see-again.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsix-burgers-fast-food-never-see-again.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsix-burgers-fast-food-never-see-again.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsix-burgers-fast-food-never-see-again.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-ana-barbara-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-ana-barbara-dating.html>Who is Ana Brbara Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pumpkin-spice-flavor-food-list.html>Pumpkin Spiced Flavor Foods: The Definitive List</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pumpkin-spice-flavor-food-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
