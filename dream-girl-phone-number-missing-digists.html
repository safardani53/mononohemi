Situations that would otherwise be "meh" or downright painful can feel like the greatest time of your life if you're in it with someone you're in love with. Waiting in line at the <a href=#>DMV</a> with the person of your dreams is a heck of a lot better than being there alone, which is even better than being there with someone you're in a bad relationship with.</p><p>And what makes love so magical is that that spark with another person is either there or it isn't. Sure, you could have a great settlement relationship with somebody else that you have love for, but that lightning bolt, Hallmark Christmas Movie love, which certainly exists for some people, defies all logic.</p><p>There's that person who just knows how to say and do all the things that turn you into a cartoon character that smells pie on a window-sill and immediately starts floating towards it, and they feel the same exact way about you. But what are the chances of us actually meeting that person in our lives? Slim.</p><p>But it seems like this Twitter user's cousin may've just found their dream person.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My 22 year old cousin met his dream girl at a bar and it's going pretty well <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZrHB8rYuoV</a></p>— Henpecked Hal (@HenpeckedHal) <a href=#>January 17, 2023</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @HenpeckedHal</span></figure><p>Popular comedy account @henpeckedhal wrote on the popular social media site: "My 22-year-old cousin met his dream girl at a bar and it's going pretty well."</p><p>He attached two photos to the tweet.
