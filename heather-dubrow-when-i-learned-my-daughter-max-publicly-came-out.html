This is the day I’m in to let the world know.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Heather-Dubrows-Daughter-Didnt-Give-Her-Warning-Before-Publicly-Coming-Out.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Real Housewives of Orange County</a> alum recalled coming home from the grocery store to learn that her daughter, whom she shares with husband <a href=#><strong>Terry Dubrow</strong></a>, <a href=#>had made a statement on social media</a>.</p><p>“I had my bag on my shoulder [and] she was, [like], ‘Hey Mom, did you see my post?’ And I was like, ‘No, I didn’t see it.’ I looked [and] I’m, like, ‘Oh, that’s so cool. I love this. This is great,’” she said. “I go, ‘Can I repost this?’ And she was like, ‘Yeah, sure.’”</p><p>Heather remembered telling Max that when she and Terry, 62, reposted the announcement it “may get a little bit more attention,” but that didn’t faze her.</p><p>“She was like, ‘Yeah, no.’ She was only worried that my caption was good,” the former Bravo star continued. “I think she just was at that spot where she was ready. She wanted to live out and open and live her truth.”</p><p>Looking back, Heather said there was one thing that “really worried” her daughter about being so open about her bisexuality: how her peers would react at school.</p><p>“She goes to a religious school and she was worried. She’s already, you know, a Jewish kid, you know — we call ourselves Bujews ’cause we’re like Buddhist Jews — but she’s like this Bujew going to this Catholic school, who’s now openly bisexual,” the Seven Year Stitch cohost told Us. “And she was worried about it and they just embraced her with so much love, and it was fantastic.”</p><p>The <a href=#>mother for four</a> — she also shares Max’s twin brother, Nicholas, 17, and daughters Katarina, 14, and Collette “Coco,” 10, with the plastic surgeon — revealed that Max’s life has continued to be “mostly all positive” since her public statement.</p><p>“I said to her at one point, I’m like, ‘You know, you’re having a little bit of a moment. What are you going to do with it?’ And I love that her response to the whole thing was, ‘I want to help other people, how can I help other people be able to come out to their family or live their truth or talk about mental health?’” Heather said. “She’s very open about having been in therapy for a long time. She has a lot of social anxiety and I just love how comfortable she is in her own skin.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Max has also started her own podcast, “<a href=#>I’ll Give It to You Straightish</a>,” and “did the whole thing herself, according to Heather. “I just love that she’s learning how to use her voice. I’ve always loved public speaking for young kids,” the <a href=#>Dubrow Diet coauthor</a> said.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGahnZGptaa%2BjJ2sm6qfrHq4tMSnZKJlnJqus7rEnWSmsV2Zrrazx62cq2WdlsVuvNSbo6KbnK56pK3MnmSoraRk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheather-dubrow-when-i-learned-my-daughter-max-publicly-came-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheather-dubrow-when-i-learned-my-daughter-max-publicly-came-out.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheather-dubrow-when-i-learned-my-daughter-max-publicly-came-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheather-dubrow-when-i-learned-my-daughter-max-publicly-came-out.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheather-dubrow-when-i-learned-my-daughter-max-publicly-came-out.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheather-dubrow-when-i-learned-my-daughter-max-publicly-came-out.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./katie-austin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./katie-austin.html>Katie Austin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./aly-michalka-wedding-stephen-ringer-italy-ceremony-pics.html>Former Disney Star Marries Stephen Ring In Italy Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./aly-michalka-wedding-stephen-ringer-italy-ceremony-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
