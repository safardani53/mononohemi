He is an American football fullback for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL).</p><p>Originally committed to Northern Illinois to play quarterback, Ingold later accepted a scholarship from Wisconsin as an uncommitted athlete.</p><p>In his senior year, the Bay Port High School football team had designated him as a dual-threat quarterback. He was selected as the Associated Press Wisconsin Player of the Year and the Gatorade Wisconsin Player of the Year.</p><p>Ingold started eleven games at Wisconsin, primarily as a fullback. He started as a linebacker until switching to running back.</p><p>His coach mostly employed him in short-yardage situations like goal-line situations, where he had a high touchdown-to-carry ratio.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ethnicity And Parents Of Alec Ingold</span></h2><p>Although the identity of Ingoldâ€™s biological parents is not revealed yet, he has mentioned that he is of mixed ethnicity.</p><p>It caused a problem for him while growing up as he was of mixed race and his parents were white.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Alec-Ingold-With-His-Parents-And-Sister.jpg><p>Ingold always knew that he was adopted before he even understood what it meant. He would always have conversations with his parents regarding this matter so that they could go through the process as soon as he knew what it meant.</p><p>However, Ingold always felt insecure, like he was not good enough because his parents put him up for adoption. He says that it did make him feel like a liability to his biological parents.&nbsp;</p><p>And as he grew up, he became a big people pleaser. People consistently pressured him to be a perfectionist to gain acceptance. He felt like he was never just good enough.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meet His Wife, Alexa Ingold</span></h2><p>Ingold is happily married to the love of his life and long-time girlfriend-turned-wife, Alexa Ingold. The couple <a href=# rel=noopener>tied the knot on June 24, 2023</a>, in St. Anthony on the Lake Catholic Church.</p><p>Alea is a Functional Medicine Physician Assistant and loves Alex very much.
