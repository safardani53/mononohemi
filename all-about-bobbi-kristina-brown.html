She landed several TV gigs between 2005 and 2012, ranging from reality shows in which she played herself to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tyler Perry</a>-directed sitcom where she made her acting debut.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to making her mark on the screen, Bobbi Kristina shined on stage from a young age — famously alongside Whitney at her concerts. When she grew older, she also recorded covers of her mom's hits, like "I'm Your Baby Tonight," a performance that was featured on Bravo's Being Bobby Brown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But despite her parents' fame and fortune, Bobbi Kristina's home life was challenging; both of her parents struggled with drug addiction, went through a difficult divorce in 2007, and Whitney died suddenly in 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Jan. 31, 2015, Bobbi Kristina was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>found unresponsive</a> in a bathtub in the Georgia home she shared with ex <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Nick Gordon</a> – an eerie parallel to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>the way her mother had died several years earlier</a>.

Her maternal grandmother was two-time Grammy Award winner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cissy Houston</a> of The Drinkard Singers — while her mother's cousins were music greats <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dee Dee Warwick</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Dionne Warwick</a> and Leontyne Price.

"Being a mother... <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>you kind of stop living for yourself and you start living for your children</a>," the singer said in a 1995 interview.
